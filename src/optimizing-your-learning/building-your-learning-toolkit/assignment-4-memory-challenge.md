## Brief

This week's assignment will require you to write about your habits and develop a plan to break one bad habit and create one good habit.

### Task 1 - Habit Identification

- Make a list of 10 - 15 habits you engage in regularly. Consider habits across various areas of your life, such as personal, professional, health, relationships, and leisure.
- Review each habit and determine how often you engage in it. Indicate whether it's daily, weekly, monthly, or once in a while.
- Now categorize each habot as positive, negative, or neutral based on their impact on your well-being, productivity, or goals. You can ask yourself the folowing questions to determine this:
  - Does this habit align with my values and goals?
  - Does it contribute positively to my well-being, relationships, or personal growth?
  - Does it detract from my productivity, health, or overall happiness?
- Determine the size of the impact that each habit has on your life, either small, medium, signfiicant.
- Select the top three habits you want to change. Prioritize habits that have a significant negative impact on your life.
- Identify a potential replacement habit for each of the three negative habits that you want to break. Think about alternative behaviors or actions that can replace the undesirable habits and move you closer to your desired outcomes.

You should create a habit inventory table that looks like this:

| Habit | Frequency | Rating | Size of Impact |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Eaiting chocolate when stressed | Daily | Negative | Medium |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

### Task 2 - Breaking a Bad Habit

- Select one of the top three negative habits that you would like to break. 
- Use the step-by step process outlined in the lesson to create a plan for breaking this habit. Be sure to mention how you would address the cue, craving, reward, and response steps.
