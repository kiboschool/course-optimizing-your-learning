# Final Presentation Milestone 3

---

By now you should be completing the learning portion of your SDL project. The milestone for this week is to create a video lesson on your topic. 

**Video Lesson Specifications**
- Your video lesson should be 5 - 10 minutes long.
- Your video should include the following information:
  - Learning outcomes - i.e. what you think the viewer will learn by watching your video lesson.
  - Content and/or activities related to your topic. This should teach your viewer the information that is listed in your learning outcomes.
  - An assessment that tests how well your viewer has achieved your learning outcomes.
  - Your video lesson should not just be a lecture, but should instead include visual elements that make the lesson engaging. Try to also include activities or questions that require the viewer to learn actively.
