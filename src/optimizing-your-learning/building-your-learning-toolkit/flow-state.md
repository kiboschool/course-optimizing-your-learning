### How do you become the best learner you can be and increase your motivation and effectiveness when learning?

Have you ever been so immersed in learning about a subject or doing something that you were so engrossed in and lost track of time? When an individual has their utmost concentration on a task in such a way that they are fully immersed in the actions and are clearly enjoying it, we refer to it as being in a ‚Äòflow‚Äô state. The good news is that as a learner, you can enter a flow state or use a flow state to drive greater engagement and effectiveness for yourself. Despite the distractions that sometimes hinder productive learning, we can take advantage of the flow state to ensure more focused and productive learning or study. In fact, flow state has been described as the brain‚Äôs most productive state.

### What Occurs When You are in Flow?

When you are in a flow state, you will feel deep enjoyment of the task, and the following will also occur:

- **Loss of self-consciousness:** You stop worrying about how you are, or will be, perceived by others.
- **Complete absorption in the task at hand:** You aren't thinking about the past or future but are instead entirely focused on what you are doing at the present moment.
- **Sense of automatic control:** You feel like you can do precisely what you want to do.
- **Altered sense of time:** You feel like time speeds up or slows down.
- **Presence of intrinsic motivation:** You don't need external rewards to do the task. You are doing it because it is rewarding for its own sake.

### How is flow important in Learning?

Several psychological factors can drive you into flow. These include:

1. Clear goals.
2. Feedback on how you are progressing towards those goals.
3. Focus on the task at hand. You need to avoid distractions when trying to get into flow.
4. An appropriate balance between skill level and the level of the challenge to avoid:
    1. Anxiety. I.e. when the challenge level is significantly above your skill level.
    2. Boredom. I.e. when your skill level is significantly above the challenge level. 
    
    Finding the right balance will leave you feeling engaged but not overwhelmed.

### Activities and Practices for Improving your flow state

- **Mediation**
    
    Mediation activity involves quieting the mind, eliminating distraction, and focusing one‚Äôs attention on a specific thing or area. The goal of meditation is to quieten the internal noise and to have a heightened sense of awareness. When we meditate, we allow ourselves to improve our attention and ability to focus. 
    
- **Mindfulness**
    
    This involves being present where and when we are at any point in time. It is easy for our thoughts to be distracted or to engage in daydreaming. When one practices mindfulness, then, they are present in the moment and are able to avoid being distracted. 
    
- **Rest/Sleep**
    
    Adequate rest and sleep allow your body and senses to get into a relaxed state of mind. You are also able to replenish lost energy. Being in a relaxed and energetic state makes it easier for you to access the flow state as opposed to being in a tired state.

üó£ "**The best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times‚Äîalthough such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile."**
