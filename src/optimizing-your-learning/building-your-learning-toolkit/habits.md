**"One of the most important keys to success is having the discipline to do what you know you should do, even when you don't feel like doing it."** 
-Todd Smith.

</aside>

As this quote suggests, being able to be consistent in your actions, especially when you don't feel like it, is one of the keys to success. But always being disciplined can be really challenging and mentally draining. Habits can help you put important actions on autopilot, so that you keep doing them without having to constantly summon up the motivation and discipline.
