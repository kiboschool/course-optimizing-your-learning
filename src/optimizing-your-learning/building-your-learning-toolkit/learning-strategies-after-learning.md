# Learning strategies after learning

*Estimated Time: 1 hours

---

In sections 4.5 - 4.7 we will discuss some strategies, tools, and techniques that can help you improve your learning through all 3 stages of self-directed learning. In this section we will focus on:

**Evaluating (After learning)**

- Self-Reflection
- Self-Evaluation

So far, we have explored learning and study strategies that you can implement. In addition, there will be other strategies that you choose to adopt in driving your learning as well as building your skills as a programmer. However, how do you evaluate your progress and know if your learning strategies are effective?

In order for you to be able to gauge your learning, self-reflection and self-evaluation are important practices you will engage in. While there are different methods to practice self-reflection and self-evaluation, you can also harness peer evaluation and feedback from an instructor or mentor.

## 1) Self-Reflection

The techniques discussed in [Section 1.5 (Reflective Practice)](/optimizing-your-learning/how-to-get-anything-you-want-in-life/reflective-practice.md) are useful for reflecting on your learning.

Some other questions to ask yourself when evaluating the quality of your learning:

- How well did I achieve my learning goals?
- What did I do that worked well? What did I do that didnâ€™t work well?
- What should I do differently next time? What should I do the same?
- What am I still confused about? Or what do I still not fully understand?

### Putting it to work

Here are some steps to take to implement self-reflection and self-evaluation in measuring your learning progress

- Review your learning goals previously
- Evaluate how much you have been able to learn
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your learning strategies in your learning achievement
- Evaluate how well you are able to apply the knowledge
- Consider how you might adapt and adjust your learning strategies for more effective outcomes
