So far, we have explored learning strategies that you can implement to plan and guide your learning. But, how can you evaluate if you your learning has been effective? 

In order for you to be able to gauge your learning, you can use self-reflection and self-evaluation.

### Reflective Learning

Reflective learning is a practice that helps you to move from being a passive learner into being an active one. It is the practice of monitoring and evaluating your own learning process with the objective of finding ways to improve. If self-directed learning puts you in charge of your learning process, then the reflective learning practice is about being able to evaluate and improve that learning process.

Reflection completes the learning process because it allows you to step back and evaluate your learning.

Reflection in Learning can happen in 2 ways:

- **Reflecting-in-action:** This is the reflection that is done when the action or the learning is ongoing. It is sometimes referred to as thinking on your feet or evaluating as you go. In a learning experience, reflecting in action might involve thinking about what you are reading, watching, or doing and exploring the impact of those actions, or deciding on potential ways to act or respond.
- **Reflecting-on-action:** This type of reflection is done after the action or learning has been completed. This on the other hand is thinking through the entire learning process that has occurred and evaluating the progress or impact.

If you recall from the previous section, the final stage of self-directed learning has to do with evaluating your learning and requires strong reflection skills. This has to do with reflecting-on-action, and for the rest of this section, we are going to explore 3 useful models for this type of reflection:

- What? So What? Now What? Model
- 5R Framework
- Gibbs‚Äô Reflective Cycle

üìô Reflection

The conscious examination of past experiences, thoughts, and ways of doing things.¬† Its goal is to surface learning about oneself and the situation and to bring meaning to it in order to inform the present and the future.¬† It challenges the status quo of practice, thoughts, and assumptions and may therefore inform our decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs, and understanding about ourselves.

**What? Now What? So What? Example**

*What?*
During the class, we focused on understanding the concept of conditionals in programming. The instructor employed interactive teaching methods, including live coding examples and class discussions. We explored various conditional statements such as if, else, and elif, and their applications in solving programming problems. Additionally, we practiced writing code snippets using conditionals and had the opportunity to seek clarification on challenging concepts.

*Now What?*
From the class, I gained a clear understanding of the syntax and structure of conditionals. I can now confidently implement these statements in my programming projects to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions. The live coding demonstrations were particularly helpful, as they provided practical examples that illustrated the logical flow of conditionals in action. This experience has motivated me to explore more complex conditional statements and delve deeper into their applications.

*So What?*
The interactive class on conditionals had several significant implications. Firstly, it empowered me to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills, as conditionals play a crucial role in designing algorithms and developing efficient code. Understanding conditionals allows me to create programs that can make decisions and adapt their behavior based on different scenarios.

Moreover, conditionals are a fundamental building block in programming, serving as the foundation for more advanced concepts and techniques. By mastering conditionals, I have acquired a versatile toolset that I can leverage in future programming endeavors. This knowledge will continue to be relevant throughout my computer science journey.

Furthermore, the interactive nature of the class fostered a collaborative learning environment. Engaging in class discussions and sharing insights with my peers allowed me to gain different perspectives and deepen my understanding of conditionals. This interaction not only enhanced my comprehension but also cultivated teamwork and communication skills, which are essential in the field of computer science.

In conclusion, the interactive class on conditionals provided me with a solid foundation for understanding and implementing these crucial programming constructs. Armed with this knowledge, I am now better equipped to write code that can make intelligent decisions and adapt to various situations. Moving forward, I plan to practice implementing conditionals in coding exercises, seek out additional resources to explore advanced conditional statements, and engage in collaborative study sessions to further enhance my skills. By continuously building upon this foundational knowledge, I am confident that I will become a proficient programmer capable of solving complex problems and contributing to the field of computer science.

### Gibbs‚Äô Reflective Cycle

<aside>

üó£Ô∏è "It is not sufficient simply to have an experience in order to learn. Without reflecting upon this experience it may quickly be forgotten, or its learning potential lost. It is from the feelings and thoughts emerging from this reflection that generalisations or concepts can be generated and it is generalisations that allow new situations to be tackled effectively."
- Graham Gibbs

Some other questions to ask yourself when evaluating the quality of your learning:

- How well did I achieve my learning goals?
- What did I do that worked well? What did I do that didn‚Äôt work well?
- What should I do differently next time? What should I do the same?
- What am I still confused about? Or what do I still not fully understand?

### Putting it to work

Here are some steps to take to implement self-reflection and self-evaluation in measuring your learning progress

- Review your learning goals regularly and determine if any need to be updated
- Evaluate how you are progressing towards your goals and how much you have been able to learn
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your learning strategies in your learning achievement
- Evaluate how well you are able to apply the knowledge that you are learning
- Consider how you might adapt and adjust your learning strategies for more effective outcomes
