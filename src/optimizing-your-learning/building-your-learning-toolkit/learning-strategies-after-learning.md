# Learning Strategies - After Learning (Evaluating)

*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

---

In sections 4.3 - 4.5 we will discuss some strategies, tools, and techniques that can help you improve your learning through all 3 stages of self-directed learning. In this section we will focus on:

**Evaluating (After learning)**

- Self-Reflection
- Self-Evaluation

So far, we have explored learning strategies that you can implement to plan and guide your learning more effectively. But, how can you evaluate if you your learning has been effective? 

In order for you to be able to gauge your learning, you can use self-reflection and self-evaluation.

## 1) Self-Reflection

When carrying out self-reflection, you can use any of the techniques discussed in [Section 1.6 (Reflective Practice)](/optimizing-your-learning/how-to-get-anything-you-want-in-life/reflective-practice.md) to reflect on how your learning has progressed.

Some other questions to ask yourself when evaluating the quality of your learning:

- How well did I achieve my learning goals?
- What did I do that worked well? What did I do that didn‚Äôt work well?
- What should I do differently next time? What should I do the same?
- What am I still confused about? Or what do I still not fully understand?

### Putting it to work

Here are some steps to take to implement self-reflection and self-evaluation in measuring your learning progress

- Review your learning goals regularly and determine if any need to be updated
- Evaluate how you are progressing towards your goals and how much you have been able to learn
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your learning strategies in your learning achievement
- Evaluate how well you are able to apply the knowledge that you are learning
- Consider how you might adapt and adjust your learning strategies for more effective outcomes
