# Learning Strategies - Before Learning (Planning)

*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

---

In sections 4.3 - 4.5 we will discuss some strategies, tools, and techniques that can help you improve your learning through all 3 stages of self-directed learning (i.e. Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluating). In this section we will focus on:

**Planning (Before Learning)**

- Goal Setting
- Implementation Intentions (and Coping Plans)

## 1) Goal Setting

To get started with the learning process, you have to set learning goals or desired outcomes for yourself so that you know wear your learning journey is trying to take you, and have a clear pciture of what success looks like. We have talked a little bit about goal setting before in this course (in section 1.5 Self-Directed Learning), but in this section we will look at how to set goals using the S.M.A.R.T framework so that they can be as useful as possible.

## 2) Implementation Intentions

One of the ways to improve your ability to achieve your goals, is to couple well set goals with something called "implementation intentions". These are "if-then" plans that specify when and how you will achieve your goals. They can also be used to state what you will do if certain things happen during your learning journey. When they are used in this way, why are sometimes called "Coping Plans".

Here is an examples of an implementation intention: "If I have finished eating breaktfast, I will spend 15 minutes working on my Mathematical Thinking problem set."

The power of implementation intentions is that you are creating concrete plans of action for how you will achieve your goals, as well as "get out of jail" plans for how to overcome obstacles. By creating these while your mind is still fresh, you are able to utilize them to reduce the cognitive burden of decision making later on. As we saw in the previous section, these can be a powerful way to create habits that support you in achieving your goals.

Implementation intensions are usually in the form of: If [situation A occurs], then I will [behavior X]. Here are some examples:

- If I wake up tomorrow morning, then I will put on my shoes and go on a 20 minute walk.
- If I am feeling tempted to eat a cookie, then I will eat an apple instead.
- If I finish brushing my teeth, then I will journal for 15 minutes.
- If there are stairs, then I will take them.

And here are examples of implementation intentions that help you manage obstacles that could get in the way of you achieving your goals (i.e. coping plans):
- If I don't understand the Mathematical Thinking material, I will go to offfice hours.
- If my code isn't running, I will share a screenshot with my squad mates and ask for help.
- If I don't understand the OYL assignment instructions, I will post a queston in the help channel on Discord.
