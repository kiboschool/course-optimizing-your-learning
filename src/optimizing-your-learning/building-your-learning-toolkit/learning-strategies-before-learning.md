# Learning Strategies - Before Learning (Planning)

*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

---

In sections 4.3 - 4.5 we will discuss some strategies, tools, and techniques that can help you improve your learning through all 3 stages of self-directed learning (i.e. Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluating). In this section we will focus on:

**Planning (Before Learning)**

- Goal Setting
- Implementation Intentions
- Learning Contracts

---

## 1) Goal setting

To get started with the learning process, you have to set learning goals or desired outcomes for yourself so that you know wear your learning journey is trying to take you, and have a clear pciture of what success looks like. We have talked about goal setting before in this course (in section 1.5 Self-Directed Learning), so in this section we will look specifically at goal setting for developers, as well as the SMART goals framework, which provides a way to set goals so that they are clear, realistic, and easy to evaluate.

From the video, some of the steps highlighted in setting learning goals are:

- Prioritization
- Structure
- Accountability

## 2) Implementation Intentions

One of the ways to improve your ability to achieve your goals, is to couple well set goals with something called "implementation intentions". These are "if-then" plans that you set before you start working towards a goal that help you state what you will do if certain things happen during your learning journey. Here is an example of an implementation intention: "If I have a bug in my code, I will spend at least 30 minutes trying to debug it myself before posting a message in the Programming 1 help channel to ask for help." The power of implementation intentions is that you are creating "get out of jail" plans while your mind is still fresh, that you can use when you hit learning challenges.

## 3) Learning Contracts

### Purpose of the Learning Contract

A learning contract gives you the ability to independently determine what you want to learn and how you want to learn it. With a learning contract, you are able to take ownership for your learning, create clear goals and timelines, source what you need for your learning, and engage with your teacher/Faculty to receive support and feedback as you complete the learning process. With the learning contract, you are able to explore different learning styles and strategies and find/stick to the ones that work for you.

As you might already know, a contract represents an agreement between 2 people and so, the learning contract in this case is an agreement between you as a student and an instructor, mentor, peer, etc. on what areas of learning have been identified. The learning contract not only holds you accountable but also gives the other party details on how they can best support you. 

To be successful, the learning contract requires you to be a self-directed learn who is ready to take ownership of your learning, as opposed to a traditional passive learner who expects to be told what, how, and when you need to learn. 

As with any general contract, it is important to detail the responsibilities of each party. The learning contract is no exception. Find below the basic responsibilities of students and teachers in using a learning contract

**Student Responsibilities**

- Identify and propose what you want to learn and how you want to learn it.
- Articulate what your outcomes, output, timelines, and learning evidence will be.
- Identify learning resources and strategies that you will employ.
- Initiate an meeting with instructor, mentor, peer, etc. to align on contents of the learning contract.
- Regularly check in with instructor, mentor, peer, etc. to review progress and get feedback.

**Instructor (Mentor, Peer, etc.) Responsibilities**

- Provide support in developing the learning contract by reviewing studentâ€™s proposal.
- Recommend learning resources, strategies, etc.
- Be available to provide feedback and meet regularly with student for support and accountability.
- Evaluate studentâ€™s completed learning evidence.

### Learning Contract Components and Examples

A typical Learning Contract will have the following core components:

**1.Â Learning Objectives and Outcome(s)**Â - define what is to be learned/accomplished in a way that is measurable. What do you intend that your learning equips you to do or to know?

**2.Â Learning Resources**Â - what materials will you need in this learning process- videos, books, documentaries, etc?

**3.Â Learning Strategies**Â - how will you learn and what activities will you engage in - field trips, class attendance, reading, completing projects, etc?

**4.Â Milestones and Timelines** - how will you accomplish each component of your learning across a time frame?

**5.Â Outputs and Assessment**Â - how will you show evidence of what you have learned - assignments/deliverables such as reports, presentations, prototypes, etc

**6. Instructor/Mentor/Peer Feedback -** evaluation of your learning accomplishment according to your Faculty/supervisor

### Steps to create and use your Learning Contract

- Identify what you want to learn and how you want to learn it. Write that down and propose it. Note that you will go through an alignment process with your Faculty on this
- Identify what learning strategies and approaches you might take to complete this learning
- Identify the learning resources and materials that you will need according to the strategies you have chosen
- Identify the milestones in your learning journey and what the timelines will be for those milestones
- Determine what assignments and deliverables you will complete to evidence your learning
- Initiate a meeting with your Faculty to discuss your initial learning contract.
- Get feedback, implement it and secure a sign off from your faculty
- Set a time to meet and ensure to meet regularly with your faculty to ensure progress
