# Learning Strategies - Before Learning (Planning)

*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

---

In sections 4.3 - 4.5 we will discuss some strategies, tools, and techniques that can help you improve your learning through all 3 stages of self-directed learning (i.e. Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluating). In this section we will focus on:

**Planning (Before Learning)**

- Goal Setting
- Implementation Intentions (and Coping Plans)

## 1) Goal Setting

To get started with the learning process, you have to set learning goals or desired outcomes for yourself so that you know wear your learning journey is trying to take you, and have a clear pciture of what success looks like. We have talked a little bit about goal setting before in this course (in section 1.5 Self-Directed Learning), but in this section we will look at how to set goals so that they can be as useful as possible.

## 2) Implementation Intentions

One of the ways to improve your ability to achieve your goals, is to couple well set goals with something called "implementation intentions". These are "if-then" plans that you set before you start working towards a goal that help you state what you will do if certain things happen during your learning journey. 

Here is an example of an implementation intention: "If I have a bug in my code, then I will spend at least 30 minutes trying to debug it myself before posting a message in the Programming 1 help channel to ask for help." The power of implementation intentions is that you are creating concreate plans of actions for how you will achieve your goals, as well as "get out of jail" plans for how to overcome obstacles. By creating these while your mind is still fresh, you are able to utilize them to reduce the cognitive burden of decision making later on.
