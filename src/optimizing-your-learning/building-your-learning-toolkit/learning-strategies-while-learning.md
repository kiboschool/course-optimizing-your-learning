- Focus and Diffuse Modes
- Chunking
- Pomodoro Technique
- Deliberate Practice
- Active Recall and Retrieval
- Spaced Repetition

## 2) Keeping a Learning Diary

The process of keeping a learning diary is simple. On the first page, draw up a daily diary and record in summary form what days and times you were engaged in your learning. Then for each study session or activity keep a record of:

- The practical details - what, when, where and how you studied
- The study methods and the various skills you used
- Your feelings about the methods of studying you used
- A note on the effectiveness of each session
- Comment on how you might change your practice to be more effective next time.

- Focused Thinking - Concentrated, conscious, and relatively predictable. 
- Diffuse Thinking - Relaxed, occurs largely subconsciously and can result in surprising connections.

## 6) Deliberate Practice

How do the very best become who they are? How do the great writers, sports people, artists, scientists, creators, and other stars emerge?

It is easy to dismiss those whose talents stand out as being gifted or having better circumstances. However, while some people‚Äôs circumstances might contribute to their excellent results, there is more to it than just circumstances of privilege or advantage. 

If you are familiar with basketball, you have probably heard about Steph Curry. He is a multiple Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner, one of the very best shooters at the basketball game, and also one of the highest-paid athletes. Watching the way he performs, you might conclude that his talent is the reason for his outstanding performance. However, according to him, ‚ÄúThere's one thing that all great shooters have in common, and that's complete control over their mechanics,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat's not something you're born with‚Äî**you have to practice it.**‚Äù (Source: Masterclass.com). Steph Curry and many others reveal to us how important practice is to learning and mastery.

The end goal of learning is not only to be informed but to improve our growth and mastery. To become not only a great learner but equally a highly valuable programmer or computer scientist, you have to develop the habit and skill of deliberate practice.

It is important to know that deliberate practice is not doing something repeatedly. It is a practice that is intentional and rooted in the goal of growth and progress. Deliberate practice helps you to move from being at a novice level in a skill to become an expert at that skill. Deliberate practice involves intentional practice, feedback, and improvement in other to correct mistakes and deepen mastery and proficiency. Here are some components of deliberate practice

- Practice should be done towards a clear goal or expert-level performance
- There should be time for reflection (metacognition) - thinking about the practice activity itself and the outcomes
- There should be feedback from someone who has better mastery such as a coach or another expert

These components among others separate deliberate practice from regular practice.

One thought about deliberate practice is that there has to be a very specific skill that you are practicing in order to give it the necessary focus. For example, a basketball player might focus on practicing and developing his shooting skills. As a software developer, that might mean focusing on a particular programming language. To engage in deliberate practice:

- **Find out your current skill/knowledge level and the gaps that you have.** When you assess your current level with the perspective of becoming an expert, you can recognize the gaps and the areas for improvement.
- **Set clear and SMART goals that stretch you.** What do you want to be able to do in a set period of time that you are not currently able to do? Identify a specific area of practice.
- **Focus** on this area of practice over time and give regular, consistent attention to it
- **Take time to reflect on your progress**, and your strategies and analyze the impact that your current approach is resulting in.
- **Get regular feedback.** As you work on your area of growth and practice, get feedback from a coach, your teacher or someone who can show you the gaps in your performance in order to find ways to improve continuously.

## 7) Active Recall and Retrieval

When we learn something, either in class or by self-study, it can either get stored in our short-term or long-term memory. Ideally, we want what we learn to get stored in our long-term memory to be able to use that over time. Our short-term memory might make it easier to recognize something we have learned in the short term but not necessarily recall it over the long term. Going back to our previous study on the neuroplasticity of the brain, we will remember that learning new information and skills requires our brains to build new connections. Recall strategies help us to do just that. 

Recall can either be **passive** or **active** with passive recall happening when what is learned is passively reviewed such as reading something multiple times over. However, active recall involves more intentional activities that stimulate the brain and engage you in bringing up and encoding the information for longer-term storage and recall.

### Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice which is also called practice testing, similar to recall is the act of bringing back information to mind. During study, we encounter new information and because we learn by making connections, it is important to be able to retrieve prior learnings in order to make connections to new concepts and ideas. 

Here are some techniques for retrieval of learning:

- Direct verbal questioning
- Self-questioning
- Writing notes from memory
- Using flashcards
- Writing essays
- Group discussion
