You may already be familiar with the concept of ‚Äòbad habits‚Äô; things that we do automatically that are negative or which do not lead us to our desired end goal. In fact, we probably all have bad habits we are trying to get rid of. However, have you ever considered that you might have some ‚Äòbad learning habits‚Äô? Some behaviours that might look helpful in the short term but hinder your ability to be a powerful learner in the long term? Learning should be fun and should have long-term value to us. However, some of these ‚Äòbad habits‚Äô can make learning tedious and ineffective. 

As we kick off this lesson on utilizing specific strategies to improve our learning, we will start by exploring habits that support or prevent us from getting the best out of the learning process.

## Bad Study Habits

These points speak to studying but are clearly relevant to the way you think of your learning journey as a whole. Let's talk about some of the "bad habits" in more detail:

- **Cramming**
    
    This is when you try to memorize a great amount of information in a short period of time. Cramming defeats the purpose of learning which is to understand, and while memorization is important and useful, cramming typically does not add much long-term retention. If you have ever crammed anything before, ask yourself how much of it you still remember. 
    
- **Passive learning**
    
    Passive learning as explained in the video is just going through the motions of learning without real engagement, reflection, and practice on what you are learning. You might be forced or you might force yourself to engage in passive learning due to the pressure of knowing you should study and just tick that box. However, such learning ends up without any real impact despite the amount of time that might have gone into it. 
    
- **Studying without a proper plan**
    
    Without a proper plan, studying might take longer, be more difficult, and might be ineffective. When you plan out your study/learning, it is easier to identify what you want to learn, how you will learn, how much time you will require, and more in order to have a meaningful study/learning experience.  
    
- **Procrastination and distraction**
    
    With all the multiple channels of information, social connection, and more online, we are more distracted than ever before especially when studying online.  We are trying to study/engage in learning while watching Instagram reels or random YouTube videos. These not only lengthen the time we spend learning but also affect our brain‚Äôs ability to focus.
    
- **Not sleeping enough**
    
    Rest is essential to the functioning of the brain and to our energy. When you do not get enough rest or sleep, you have low energy as well as an inability to focus or concentrate. This will negatively impact the quality of your learning. 
    
These are just a few of the several bad learning and study habits you might have picked up at some point that makes the learning process more tedious for you than it should be. The good news is you can learn new and more effective learning approaches and strategies. We will explore these more in the coming lessons.
