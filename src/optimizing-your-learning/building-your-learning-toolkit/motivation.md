You might be already familiar with the concept of ‚Äòbad habits‚Äô - meaning things that we do repeatedly which are negative or which do not lead us to our desired end goal. In fact, we probably all have bad habits we are trying to get rid of. And that is okay because it is part of what growth is all about. However, have you ever considered that you might have some ‚Äòbad habits‚Äô in the way that you learn? Some behaviours that might look helpful in the short term but hinder your ability to be a powerful learner in the long term? Learning should be fun and should have long-term value to us. However, some of these ‚Äòbad habits‚Äô can make learning tedious and make us have a wrong perspective towards learning. 

As we kick off this lesson on implementing self-directed learning through specific learning strategies and behaviours, we will start out by exploring habits that prevent us from getting the best out of learning.

These points speak to studying but are clearly relevant to the way you think of your learning journey as well, as study is a form of learning. I want to highlight some of these habits and talk about them a bit more below:

- **Cramming**
    
    Most of us have been guilty of this at some point as students/learners. This is when you try to memorize a great amount of information most times in a short period of time. Many students who cram do so when it is close to tests or examinations just to pass that examination or test. Cramming in itself defeats the purpose of learning which is to understand and while memorization is important and useful, cramming to remember learning content might seem to work in the short term but does not add much long-term value. If you have ever crammed anything before, ask yourself how much of it you still remember. 
    
- **Passive learning**
    
    Passive learning as explained in the video is just going through the motions of learning without real engagement, reflection, and practice on what you are learning. You might be forced or you might force yourself to engage in passive learning due to the pressure of knowing you should study and just tick that box. However, such learning ends up without any real impact despite the length of time that might have gone into it. 
    
- **Studying without a proper plan**
    
    Without a proper plan, studying might take longer, be more difficult, and might be ineffective. When you plan out your study/learning, it is easier to identify what you want to learn, how you will learn, how much time you will require, and more in order to have a meaningful study/learning experience.  
    
- **Procrastination and distraction**
    
    With all the multiple channels of information, social connection, and more online, we are more distracted than ever before especially when studying online.  We are trying to study/engage in learning while watching Instagram reels or random YouTube videos. These not only elongate the time we have to focus on learning but also affect our brain‚Äôs ability to focus.
    
- **Not sleeping enough**
    
    Rest is essential to the functioning of the brain and to our energy. When you do not get enough rest or sleep, you have low energy as well as an inability to focus or concentrate. This will clearly impact the quality of your learning negatively. 
    
These are just a few of the several bad learning and study habits you might have picked up at some point that makes the learning process more tedious for you than it should be. The good news is you can learn new and more effective learning approaches and strategies. We will explore these more in the coming lessons.
