    1. The overall topic of your self-directed learning assignment will be the programming language, Python.
    2. Your first task is to **determine 1 thing that you would like to learn about Python.**
2. **Task 2: Create Your SDL Plan**
    1. Now that you have your learning goal, you will need to put together a plan for how you will accomplish that goal over the course of 1 week learning period. In your plan be sure to include how you will assess whether you have achieved your learning goal.
3. **Task 3: Implement Your SDL Plan**
    1. Now that you have your plan in place, you will need to implement your plan so that you can achieve your learning goal. Once you have implemented your plan you will need to evaluate how well you have achieved your learning goal.
