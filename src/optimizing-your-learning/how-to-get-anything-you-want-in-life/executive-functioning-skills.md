ðŸ“™ **Executive Function:**
A set of cognitive processes that help us self-regulate so we can effectively plan, prioritize, and sustain effort towards our long-term goals.

</aside>

## Brain functions that support executive functioning

- **Flexible Attention (Mental Flexibility):** "Helps us to sustain or shift attention in response to different demands or to apply different rules in different settings."

<aside>
  
**Meet Alex**

Alex is a Kibo student with poor flexible attention skills. He often finds it challenging to shift his focus between different tasks, adapt to changes in routines or plans, and prioritize effectively. Here's an example of a day in his life:

**Morning**
Alex wakes up and checks his phone for notifications. He gets engrossed in scrolling through social media, responding to messages, and watching videos. As a result, he loses track of time and ends up running late for his morning class.

**Mid-morning:**
In class, his Programming 1 instructor announces a change in the course plan for the next two weeks and provides an updated assignment due date. However, Alex fails to fully grasp the changes, and does not adjust his study plans accordingly.

**Lunchtime:**
Alex meets up with a squadmate for lunch. As they eat, his friend mentions an upcoming career event that clashes with a group project meeting scheduled later in the day. Despite the conflict, Alex doesn't think about the option of shifting the group meeting, and instead insists that all squad members should miss out on the career event and attend the meeting.

**Afternoon:**
Alex heads to the Lagos Hub to study. He sits down at a table with his laptop an notes, intending to work on an assignment. However, his attention becomes fixated on a nearby conversation between two other students, making it hard for him to concentrate on his own work. He struggles to filter out the distraction and shift his attention back to his studies.

**Evening:**
Alex receives an email from his Communicating for Success instructor, providing feedback on a recent assignment and requesting revisions. However, when he starts reading the email, he becomes overwhelmed by the amount of feedback and struggles to focus on the specific areas that need improvement. He finds it difficult to prioritize the revisions and decide where to start.
  
</aside>

- **Working Memory:** "Governs our ability to retain and manipulate distinct pieces of information over short periods of time."

<aside>
  
**Meet Akua**
  
Akua is a Kibo student with poor working memory skills. She struggles with remembering and manipulating information in her mind, leading to difficulties in following instructions, recalling information, and organizing her thoughts. Here's an example of a day in her life:
  
**Morning:**
Akua wakes up and checks her calendar to see which classes and appointments she has for the day. However, when she leaves her home to go to her in-person classes at KNUST, she forgets both her phone and laptop at home, so she has to rely on her memory to recall the information about her schedule, which leads to confusion and delays. She even forgets to show up for her monhtly meeting with her Kibo student advisor.

**Mid-morning:**
In her first class, the instructor assigns a short in-class writing exercise. Akua listens attentively to the instructions but struggles to retain the details and the specific structure required. As a result, she feels overwhelmed and finds it difficult to organize her thoughts and produce a coherent response.

**Afternoon:**
Akua heads to the library to work on a writing assignment. She spends time gathering information. However, as she tries to integrate the information into her writing, she struggles to recall the main points and connect them coherently. She finds it challenging to hold multiple pieces of information in mind simultaneously.

**Late Afternoon:**
Akua attends a study group session for one of her courses. As the group discusses different concepts and problem-solving strategies, Akua finds it difficult to follow the conversation and retain the important details. She frequently asks others to repeat information or explain concepts multiple times.

**Evening:**
Akua sits down to complete an online assignment that requires her to follow a series of steps. However, she struggles to hold the instructions in mind long enough to execute them accurately. She often has to refer back to the instructions repeatedly, which slows down her progress and affects her efficiency.

</aside>

- **Inhibitory Control (Impulse Inhibition):** "Enables us to set priorities and resist impulsive actions or responses."

<aside>
  
**Meet Juma**

Juma is a Kibo student with poor inhibitory control skills. He often struggles with impulse control, emotional regulation, and resisting distractions, leading to difficulties in staying focused, managing time effectively, and making informed decisions. Here's an example of a day in Juma's life:

**Morning:**
Juma wakes up and plans to start his day by studying for an upcoming exam. However, he finds it challenging to resist the temptation of checking his phone for notifications and getting caught up in social media. As a result, he ends up spending more time than intended on his phone, delaying his study session.

**Mid-morning:**
Juma attends the Web Foundations office hours where the instructor is walking through an approach to overcome a common challenge students have been having with this week's assignment. However, while the instructor is speaking, Juma's mind wanders, and he starts daydreaming. As a result he misses out on critical information.

**Lunchtime:**
At lunch, Juma plans to grab a healthy meal. However, as he is walking to the nearest shop, he notices his favorite fast food joint nearby and succumbs to the temptation, choosing an unhealthy meal instead. He finds it hard to resist the immediate gratification of the unhealthy food choice.

**Evening:**
Juma plans to spend the evening reviewing his notes and preparing for a class presentation. However, when he sits down to study, he gets easily distracted by notifications on his phone, social media updates, and online videos. He finds it difficult to resist the distractions and focus on his academic tasks.

**Night:**
As the day comes to an end, Juma intends to go to bed early to ensure a good night's sleep for an early morning class. However, he struggles to resist the temptation of staying up late to watch anime.

  <details>
  <summary> Open to see some useful advice for Alex (or anyone with flexible attention challenges). </summary>
  
- Morning:
    - Set a specific time limit for phone usage in the morning to avoid getting engrossed in social media. Use apps or features that limit screen time or set reminders to help manage phone usage.
    - Establish a morning routine that includes tasks like setting an alarm, getting ready, and organizing materials needed for the day. Following a routine can help create structure and improve time management.
- Mid-morning:
    - Develop a habit of actively listening and taking notes during class to improve information processing and flexibility. Practice summarizing key points and checking for updates or changes in the syllabus regularly.
    - If there are any changes or announcements in class, write them down immediately and review the syllabus afterward to update study plans accordingly.
 - Lunchtime:
    - Practice active listening and engage in mindful conversations with friends. Pay attention to details and actively participate in discussions to improve flexibility in social interactions.
    - When conflicting events arise, take a moment to consider the options and be open to adjusting plans. 
    - Communicate with the group to discuss alternative meeting times or find solutions that accommodate everyone's schedules.
 - Afternoon:
    - Find a quiet and distraction-free study environment to help improve focus and attention. Use earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones, or study in a secluded setting to minimize external distractions.
    - Implement techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for a set period (e.g., 25 minutes) and then take a short break (e.g., 5 minutes) to rest and reset your attention.
