# What happens in your brain when you learn?

Have you ever considered how learning happens? And specifically, how ***your own*** learning happens? What actually occurs in your brain when you learn how to correctly write a for loop in Python or differentiate between boolean operators?

As mentioned in the [**Motivation section**](/optimizing-your-learning/how-to-get-anything-you-want-in-life/motivation.md), learning is about growth and change. So letâ€™s start by exploring how your brain changes over time.

The ability of your brain to change, by creating, strengthening, weakening, or dismantling connections between your neurons.

## Reflection: Neuroplasticity in Action

ðŸªž Think about something that you are really good at; something that you can currently do with very little effort. What did it feel like when you first tried to do this thing?
**Post your answer in the padlet bellow.**

With use, our brains have the ability to improve, expand and grow. The concept of neural pathways in the brain explains how we can learn something and get better at it. When you are doing something for the first time, it is usually harder compared to when you have done it several times (i.e. practiced it) because you donâ€™t have strong neural pathways in place yet. With each repetition of the activity, your brain creates a stronger pathway that makes it even easier to do the task with reduced effort compared to the initial attempts.

Most people describe learning to code as a difficult process. This is because there might not have been prior neural pathways developed for coding. Even when you have learned to code using a different programming language, learning a new one might sometimes have some level of difficulty. However, it will be less difficult because you have built some neural pathways for programming in general.

So what does this mean for you as you embark on your computer science journey?

When you are struggling to learn a new skill or understand a new piece of knowledge, remember that this is how the brain works in the process of learning anything. **Everything is hard until it becomes easy.**  So be confident in your learning, trust your brain, practice the skill to develop your neural pathways, and be patient with yourself as your neural pathways develop.



Remember, it might be difficult at the start but with the strengthening of the neural pathways in your brain through practice, you will increase your comfort and mastery of the subject.
