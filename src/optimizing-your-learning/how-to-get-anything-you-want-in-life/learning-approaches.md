# Learning Approaches

*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

---

So far in Lesson 1, we have learnt about how learning happens in the brain, and how certain cognitive skills can influence how well you are able to manage your learning. In this section, we will explore the different ways in which people leverage their neuroplasticity and cogntive skills to learn. There have been a lot of controversies around the concept of ‚Äúlearning styles‚Äù, so before we jump into the lesson, let‚Äôs watch a video that talks about the misconception of learning styles.

## VARK Learning Theory

The VARK Learning Theory establishes that there are 4 main ways that people can learn (sometimes called ‚Äúlearning styles‚Äù), which are as follows:

| Learning Approach | Description | Questions to Consider | Learning Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visual | Preference for consuming information in a visual format. This might include photos, charts, illustrations, videos, and other formats which can be appreciated by the eyes. | Are art, beauty, and aesthetics important to you? Does visualizing information in your mind help you remember it better? Do you have to see information in order to remember it? Do you pay close attention to body language? | Watch videos; Map and diagram; Detect patterns; Draw ideas out; Write notes in different fonts, colors, and formats |
| Auditory | Preference for listening or absorbing and assimilating information into the ears.  | Do you create songs to help remember information?  Does reading out loud help you remember information better? Do you prefer to listen to class lectures rather than reading from the textbook? Would you prefer to listen to a recording of your class lectures or a podcast rather than going over your class notes? | Listen to lectures; Listen to podcasts; Engage in group discussions; Talk things through (with yourself or others); Create audio recordings of your notes; Use a text-to-speech app; Use narratives to understand new ideas |
| Read/Write | Preference for exploring and capturing through note-taking to foster understanding and remembering later through reading. | Do you enjoy making lists, reading definitions, and creating presentations? Do you find reading your textbook to be a great way to learn new information? Do you take a lot of notes during class and while reading textbooks? Do you prefer it when teachers make use of overheads and handouts? | Create lists, categories, etc; Read textbooks, articles, handouts, etc; Write notes; Use post it notes |
| Kinaesthetic | Preference for learning with the use of one‚Äôs hands to observe things, learn how they work, or create things  | Are you good at applied activities such as painting, cooking, mechanics, sports, and woodworking? Do you enjoy performing tasks that involve directly manipulating objects and materials? Do you have to actually practice doing something in order to learn it? Do ideas make more sense to you when you see a real-world example? | Create things; Use case studies and examples; Engage in simulation or role-play; Participate in labs|

At some point, you have likely learned effectively in most of the above formats. And, as the first video in this section explains, no proof has been found to support the conclusion that individual learning styles make learning more efficient or effective. But what do some of the proponents of learning styles think?

**Some additional helpful points from the video to note include:**

- Learning happens when meaning is associated with something and this can happen in a variety of ways
- Learning approaches will depend on what needs to be learned or taught
- Subjects can be learned using multiple approaches
- We are all capable of learning in a variety of ways and with a variety of approaches.

**Don‚Äôt limit yourself with ‚ÄòLearning Styles‚Äô!**

It is common for people to blame their lack of effort or success in a particular area of learning on learning styles. Don‚Äôt do this. Rather than focus on fixed learning styles as a limitation, you can expand your learning possibilities through learning preferences. And think about how you can utilize multiple approaches to learning in your learning routine.

## Discuss: Learning Approaches

<aside>


üí¨ Chose one of the four learning approaches presented above (i.e. Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinaesthetic) and describe one way that you could use it to your advantage when learning how to code. Add your suggestion to the appropriate column in the padlet below.
