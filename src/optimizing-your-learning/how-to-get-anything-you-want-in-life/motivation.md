## Discussion: What is Learning?

<aside>


💬 **How would you define learning in your own words?**
Post your definition in the padlet below.

**Here are some ways in which education experts have defined learning:**

<aside>
“A change in human disposition or capability that persists over a period of time and is not simply ascribable to processes of growth.”
Robert Gagne
</aside>

<aside>
“Learning is the relatively permanent change in a person’s knowledge or behavior due to experience.”
Richard E. Mayer
</aside>
  
<aside>
“We define learning as the transformative process of taking in information that—when internalized and mixed with what we have experienced—changes what we know and builds on what we do. It’s based on input, process, and reflection. It is what changes us.”
Marcia Conner
</aside>
 
<aside>

“It has been suggested that the term learning defies precise definition because it is put to multiple uses. Learning is used to refer to (1) the acquisition and mastery of what is already known about something, (2) the extension and clarification of the meaning of one’s experience, or (3) an organized, intentional process of testing ideas relevant to problems. In other words, it is used to describe a product, a process, or a function."
RM Smith

<aside>
“Acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities.”
Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel
</aside>
  
<aside>
“A process that leads to change, which occurs as a result of experience and increases the potential of improved performance and future learning.”
Susan Ambrose
</aside>
  
<aside>
“A persisting change in human performance or performance potential…[which] must come about as a result of the learner’s experience and interaction with the world.”
M. Driscoll
</aside>


**When you read these definitions, a couple of words appear repeatedly:**

- **Change**
- **Experience**
- **Interactions**
- **Process**
- **Future…problems, opportunities**

<aside>


🤔 **Think about who you were 10 years ago.** 
Do you currently have different knowledge, skills, preferences, and behaviours than you did back then? 

**Think about who you want to be in 10 years’ time.**
Will you need new knowledge, skills, and behaviours to achieve your imagined future?

</aside>


**Learning is the skill that has made you into who you are today, and it is what will transform you into who you will be in the future.**

# What is Meta-learning, and Why is it Important?

## Reflection: Your Experience of Learning

<aside>


🪞 **Answer the questions in the padlet below.**

</aside>

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/pbc4gub4bldu7qsi" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

We are accustomed to learning about different subjects or developing new skills and interests, but we don’t often think about how we actually learn, or even plan our learning intentionally so that it is as effective as possible. Even in school, a lot of learning is focused on “what to learn”, but rarely “how to learn.” However, understanding how we learn can be really useful for optimizing our individual learning processes.

📺 Watch the following video with Jim Kwik to discover why the skill of learning is worth understanding and optimizing.

🗣 “If you can learn how to learn, you can grant all your wishes.” - Jim Kwik

</aside>

In the video, Kwik asserts that meta-learning (i.e. thinking about how to learn) is a vital skill because if you know how to learn, then you will be able to learn anything you want or need to learn. You will be able to decide what you want to accomplish in the future and have the ability to learn the skills, knowledge, and mindsets that are required to help you transform from your current state into that future state. 

This ability is critical in a field like computer science that is in constant evolution. For example, new programming languages and frameworks are frequently developed. And as a technical professional, constant learning is critical for keeping up and continually delivering cutting-edge work.

📺 Watch this clip from Nabila (a Kibo mentor and Sofware Engineer at Google), as she talks about the importance of learning as a tech professional.

Beyond computer science, the world at large is also on a rapid trajectory of change. The term [VUCA](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/VUCA-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity) (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) is often used to describe the state of the modern world.  Many sectors and industries are evolving rapidly. In fact, according to ‘The Future of Economy’ Report published by the Institute for the Future (IFTF) and Dell technologies, a lot of jobs that will exist in 2030 do not exist today. Furthermore, Knowledge Obsolescence (defined as “the condition of knowledge becoming outdated or superseded due to the emergence of newer, more relevant knowledge or need for additional currency or relevance.” (IGI Global, 2022)) means that a significant amount of knowledge that you currently hold may be outdated and useless within the next 5 years. Therefore, the priority should be to focus on **how to learn** so that you can adapt beyond just knowing current skills and knowledge, and instead learn whatever you need to learn as it becomes relevant or required in the future.

This lifelong learning becomes more effective when you understand the principles behind learning, how you learn, and the strategies that help you learn more efficiently and effectively.
