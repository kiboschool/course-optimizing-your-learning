## Reflective Learning

Reflective learning is a practice that helps you to move from being a passive learner into being an active one. It is the practice of monitoring and evaluating your own learning process with the objective of finding ways to improve. If self-directed learning puts you in charge of your learning process, then the reflective learning practice is about being able to evaluate and improve that learning process.

Reflection completes the learning process because it allows you to step back and evaluate the learning process.

Reflection in Learning can happen in 2 ways:

- **Reflecting-in-action:** This is the reflection that is done when the action or the learning is ongoing. It is sometimes referred to as thinking on your feet or evaluating as you go. In a learning experience, reflecting in action might involve thinking about what you are reading, watching, or doing and exploring the impact of those actions, or deciding on potential ways to act or respond.
- **Reflecting-on-action:** This type of reflection is done after the action or learning has been completed. This on the other hand is thinking through the entire learning process that has occurred and evaluating the progress or impact.

If you recall from the previous section, the final stage of self-directed learning has to do with evaluating your learning and requires strong reflection skills. This has to do with reflecting-on-action, and for the rest of this section, we are going to explore 3 useful models for this type of reflection:

- What? So What? Now What? Model
- 5R Framework
- Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle

📙 **Reflection**

> The conscious examination of past experiences, thoughts, and ways of doing things.  Its goal is to surface learning about oneself and the situation and to bring meaning to it in order to inform the present and the future.  It challenges the status quo of practice, thoughts, and assumptions and may therefore inform our decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs, and understanding about ourselves.

## What? So What? Now What? Model

<aside>


📺 Watch the following video on the What? So What? Now What? Model

</aside>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGyjF9Ngd8Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Steps of What? So What? Now What? Model:

- **What? - D**escribe the situation you want to learn from. Identify the facts and feelings of the situation.
- **So What?** Extract the meaning of what you experienced, question what knowledge you and others had in the situation, and what knowledge could help you make sense of the situation.
- '**Now what? - c**reate an action plan for the future based on the previous questions.

## 5R Framework

<aside>


📖 Read more about the [**5R framework**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/5r-framework).

</aside>


Steps of the 5R framework:

- **Reporting** of the context of the experience
- **Responding** to the experience (observations, feelings, thoughts, etc.)
- **Relating** the experience to knowledge and skills you already have
- **Reasoning** about the significant factors/theory to explain the experience
- **Reconstructing** your practice by planning future actions for a similar experience

## Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle

📺 Watch the following video on Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle

Steps of Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle:

- **Description** of the experience
- **Feelings** and thoughts about the experience
- **Evaluation** of the experience, both good and bad
- **Analysis** to make sense of the situation
- **Conclusion** about what you learned and what you could have done differently
- **Action plan** for how you would deal with similar situations in the future, or general changes you might find appropriate.
