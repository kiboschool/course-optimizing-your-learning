## Reflective Learning

Reflective learning is a practice that helps you to move from being a passive learner into being an active one. It is the practice of monitoring and evaluating your own learning process with the objective of finding ways to improve. If self-directed learning puts you in charge of your learning process, then the reflective learning practice is about being able to evaluate and improve that learning process.

Reflection completes the learning process because it allows you to step back and evaluate your learning.

Reflection in Learning can happen in 2 ways:

- **Reflecting-in-action:** This is the reflection that is done when the action or the learning is ongoing. It is sometimes referred to as thinking on your feet or evaluating as you go. In a learning experience, reflecting in action might involve thinking about what you are reading, watching, or doing and exploring the impact of those actions, or deciding on potential ways to act or respond.
- **Reflecting-on-action:** This type of reflection is done after the action or learning has been completed. This on the other hand is thinking through the entire learning process that has occurred and evaluating the progress or impact.

If you recall from the previous section, the final stage of self-directed learning has to do with evaluating your learning and requires strong reflection skills. This has to do with reflecting-on-action, and for the rest of this section, we are going to explore 3 useful models for this type of reflection:

- What? So What? Now What? Model
- 5R Framework
- Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle

<aside>
📙 Reflection

The conscious examination of past experiences, thoughts, and ways of doing things.  Its goal is to surface learning about oneself and the situation and to bring meaning to it in order to inform the present and the future.  It challenges the status quo of practice, thoughts, and assumptions and may therefore inform our decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs, and understanding about ourselves.

## What? So What? Now What? Model

<aside>


📺 Watch the following video on the What? So What? Now What? Model

</aside>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGyjF9Ngd8Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Steps of What? So What? Now What? Model:

- **What? -** Describe the situation.
- **So What?** - Identify key takeaways from your experience.
- **Now What?** - Determine what you will do differently in the future, based on what you learned from the experience.

## 5R Framework

<aside>


📖 Read more about the [**5R framework**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/5r-framework).

</aside>


You can watch a video on the 5R framework [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scibb0kd4jw).


Steps of the 5R framework:

- **Reporting** 
- **Responding**
- **Relating** 
- **Reasoning**
- **Reconstructing**

## Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle

<aside>


🗣️ "It is not sufficient simply to have an experience in order to learn. Without reflecting upon this experience it may quickly be forgotten, or its learning potential lost. It is from the feelings and thoughts emerging from this reflection that generalisations or concepts can be generated and it is generalisations that allow new situations to be tackled effectively."
- Graham Gibbs
