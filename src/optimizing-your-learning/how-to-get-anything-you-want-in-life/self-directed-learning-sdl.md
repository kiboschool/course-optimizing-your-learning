ü™û *Think back to the last time that you bought a new gadget (e.g. mobile phone, camera, computer, games console). How did you first learn how to use it?*

**Post your answer in the padlet below.**

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/xdpqjjfctb4avf8" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

I will assume that you unpacked the device, read the user manual (or not ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), watched some YouTube videos about your new device, or maybe even asked people who owned this model before you about some of the steps and hacks that could help you to get the best out of your new device. If this describes what you did, then you demonstrated self-directed learning. One of the reasons this was effective was because you had a clear goal, you wanted to be able to get the best out of this new device.

Self-directed learning is a learning process where you take responsibility to initiate and perform your own learning around a subject matter. This has numerous benefits, including strengthening your confidence as a learner and improving engagement and retention with what you are learning.

# What is Self-Directed Learning?

<aside>


üìô ***Self-directed learning**
The ability to set goals, plan for achievement, independently manage time and effort, and independently assess the quality of one's learning and any resulting product.*

Self-directed learning allows you to take responsibility for your own learning, which results in greater ownership and autonomy. In self-directed learning, the teacher acts as a guide/facilitator/consultant to support you and give you feedback during your learning journey.

# Are You Ready For Self-Directed Learning?

<aside>


‚ùì Take the following self-assessment to see if you are ready for self-directed learning.

## Readiness to Learn v. Willingness to Learn

<aside>

**Readiness to Learn: This means a learner has all the logical tools and circumstances for being a prepared and capable learner in place.**¬†

It can include things like basic skills (such as literacy, numeracy, and the like), research and information skills, cognitive skills, critical thinking skills, life skills, communication and collaboration skills, and more. It can also mean having an actual problem to solve or a challenge to face‚Äîin essence, a purpose for¬†the learning to happen. This is the toolbox that enables learning to take place.
    
</aside>

<aside>


**Willingness to Learn:** **This is all about the¬†desire to learn.¬†It means having a real love of discovery and development and being curious and open to learning from failure.** 
    
It‚Äôs a willingness to dig in and get messy with learning and make new realizations along the way. Here we also show an interest in the expertise and wisdom of others and see everyone and everything as a potential source of meaningful learning. These are things that make our learning appealing, relevant, useful, and rewarding.

# How can you become a more self-directed learner?

## The Self-Directed Learning Process

There are three main stages to the self-directed learning process:
1) Planning = Things you do BEFORE learning takes place.
2) Monitoring = Things you do DURING the learning activity.
3) Evaluating = Things you do AFTER the learning activity.

The table below outlines behaviors that effective self-directed learners exhibit in each of these three stages.

| Planning | Monitoring | Evaluating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goal Setting | Attention and Focusing | Self-Evaluation |
| Strategic Planning | Focusing¬† | Reflection |
| Diagnosing Learning Needs | Self-Instruction¬† | Adaptability |
| Determining Learning Strategy | Self-Monitoring¬† |  |
|  | Help-Seeking |  |

[Source](https://www.learningpersonalized.com/holy-trinity-self-direction-self-managing-self-monitoring-self-modifying/)


Here is some useful expansions on some of the key terms in the table:
- **Diagnosing Learning needs:** It all starts with questions like: what do I not know? What do I need to learn and why do I want to learn this? In the example of the new device at the beginning of this lesson, the learner wants to be able to use their new device (perhaps a phone in this case) effectively. 

- **Goal Setting:** Taking the learning needs one step further, the learner formulates clear goals by asking questions like what will I learn? what will I be able to do once I have completed my learning? etc. In the example, the owner might want to be able to use specific applications or perform some other specific function.

- **Strategic Planning and Determing a Learning Strategy:** In order to build upon existing knowledge and ideas, the learner has to determine appropriate approach to, and resources for, learning. 

- **Self-Evaluation:** After learning strategies are implemented, the learner then evaluates their learning to see how effective the process was. Using their learning goals as a benchmark, the learner can ascertain how effective their learning process was and can subsequently improve on it. 


When setting out to direct your own learning, it can be useful to ask yourself the following questions in order to help shape and guide you through the process.
[Adapted from Source](https://blog.futurefocusedlearning.net/10-self-directed-learning-questions)

###Planning

- **1. WHAT DO I WANT OR NEED TO LEARN?**
    
- **2. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**
    - What is important or necessary? (e.g. Is there a specific problem to be solved? Is there a challenge that I need to face? Is there information that will construct something of value to me or others?)
    - What is the context that is driving me to learn this? (e.g. Is this a hobby or skill? Is this for personal knowledge development? Is this learning for a job or a career development?)
    - What else has motivated me to seek this knowledge?
    - Why is this meaningful to me or to others?
    - What would happen if I don‚Äôt find out what I need to or didn‚Äôt develop my skills adequately?
    - How will this knowledge change things for me or others?
- **3. HOW DO I INTEND TO USE THIS KNOWLEDGE?**
    - For personal development? For problem-solving? For general interest?For use in other learning challenges? To respond to specific questions?
- **5. WHAT ARE MY CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS?**
    - Capabilities - What do I know or what can I do now that will help me?
    - Limitations - What can‚Äôt I do? And can I learn how to do it? (considering timeframe, budget, etc.)
- **4. WHAT DO I KNOW ALREADY AND WHAT DO I NEED TO FIND OUT?**
    - What do I already know about this topic from different sources (e.g. my assumptions, personal experience, other people)?
    - Missing knowledge
        - What don‚Äôt I know about the who, what, where, when, why, and how relating to this topic?
        - What is the history of the problem or challenge? What is known by others?
        - What have others missed in the past? What is still unknown by others?
- **6. WHERE CAN I FIND OUT WHAT I NEED TO KNOW?**
    - What traditional sources can I use? (e.g. Books, articles, film, art and design, conversation/collaboration, courses, hands-on workshops, seminars, mentoring/practicums.)
    - What online sources can I use? (e.g. websites, blogs, wikis, videos, podcasts, online learning/MOOCs)
- **7. HOW WILL MY LEARNING ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE?**
    - Where will I learn? 
    - How will I learn? 
    - With whom will I learn? 
    - What will be the structure of my learning sessions? Frequency, duration, etc.
- **8. HOW WILL I KNOW MY LEARNING WAS SUCCESSFUL? (QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE LEARNING)**
    - What would success look like? And how will I measure that?
    - What evidence do I need to collect in order to evaluate my success?
    - How will I collect this evidence?

By the end of the planning stage, you should have a strong sense of why what you are learning is important to you, what you wnat to accomplish, how far your current abilities are from that goal, how you plan to close the gap, and how you will know when the gap is closed. You have essentially created the map for your learning, which you can use to drive the rest of the process. 

![Map](./map.jpeg)



###Monitoring

- **09. HOW DO I KNOW MY LEARNING IS PROGRESSING SUCCESSFULLY? (QUESTIONS TO ASK DURING LEARNING)**
    - What evidence do I need to collect in order to evaluate my progress
    - How will I collect this evidence?
- **10. WHAT WILL I DO WHEN I HIT A ROADBLOCK?**
    - What will I do if I don‚Äôt understand something?
    - What will I do if I get interrupted while learning?
    - What will I do if the learning seems too hard, or boring, or I don‚Äôt feel engaged in learning?
- **11. WHO CAN I ASK FOR HELP WHILE LEARNING?**
    - Family, friends, and teachers? Other professionals and experienced enthusiasts? Peers/Advanced Peers? Those who have failed to solve the problem and gained insights from that?

Once you begin your learning journey (you are traversing your map), you will need tools to help you know if you are heading in the right direction. You will also want to interact with guides a long the way that can help you if you get stuck.

![Compas](./compas.jpeg)

##Evaluating

- **12. HOW WILL I KNOW MY LEARNING WAS SUCCESSFUL? (QUESTIONS TO ASK AFTER LEARNING)**
    - What were the results of my efforts?
    - How did I succeed or fall short of accomplishing my goal?
    - What went well, and what didn‚Äôt?
    - How can I improve my efforts, processes, and outcomes in the future?


The critical question to ask yourself when you think that your learning is complete is "How do I know my learning is complete and that I have actually reached my goal?"
