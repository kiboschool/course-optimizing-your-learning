ü™û *Think back to the last time that you bought a new gadget (e.g. mobile phone, camera, computer, games console). How did you first learn how to use it?*

**Post your answer in the padlet below.**

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/xdpqjjfctb4avf8" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

I will assume that you unpacked the device, read the user manual (or not ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), watched some YouTube videos about your new device, or maybe even asked people who owned this model before you about some of the steps and hacks that could help you to get the best out of your new device. If this describes what you did, then you demonstrated self-directed learning. One of the reasons this was effective was because you had a clear goal, you wanted to be able to get the best out of this new device.

Self-directed learning is a learning process where you take responsibility to initiate and perform your own learning around a subject matter. This has numerous benefits, including strengthening your confidence as a learner and improving engagement and retention with what you are learning.

# What is Self-directed Learning?

<aside>


üìô ***Self-directed learning**
The ability to set goals, plan for achievement, independently manage time and effort, and independently assess the quality of one's learning and any resulting product.*

Self-directed learning allows you to take responsibility for your own learning, which results in greater ownership and autonomy. In self-directed learning, the teacher acts as a guide/facilitator to support you and give you feedback on your learning process and learning journey.

# Are You Ready For Self-Directed Learning?

<aside>


‚ùì Take the following self-assessment to see if you are ready for self-directed learning.

## Readiness to Learn v. Willingness to Learn

<aside>

**Readiness to Learn: This means a learner has all the logical tools and circumstances for being a prepared and capable learner in place.**¬†

It can include things like basic skills (such as literacy, numeracy, and the like), research and information skills, cognitive skills, critical thinking skills, life skills, communication and collaboration skills, and more. It can also mean having an actual problem to solve or a challenge to face‚Äîin essence, a purpose for¬†the learning to happen. This is the toolbox that enables learning to take place.
    
</aside>

<aside>


**Willingness to Learn:** **This is all about the¬†desire to learn.¬†It means having a real love of discovery and development and being curious and open to learning from failure.** 
    
It‚Äôs a willingness to dig in and get messy with learning and make new realizations along the way. Here we also show an interest in the expertise and wisdom of others and see everyone and everything as a potential source of meaningful learning. These are things that make our learning appealing, relevant, useful, and rewarding.

## The Self-Directed Learning Process

![learning experience sdl cycle](./self-directed-learning-sdl/learning-experience-sdl-cycle.png)


| Planning (Things to do BEFORE learning takes place) | Monitoring (Things to do DURING the learning activity) | Evaluating (Things to do AFTER the learning activity) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goal Setting - Taking the learning needs one step further, the learner formulates clear goals by asking questions like what will I learn? what will I be able to do once I have completed my learning? etc. In the example, the owner might want to be able to use specific applications or perform some other specific function. | Attention and Focusing | Self-Evaluation - After learning strategies are implemented, the learner then evaluates their learning to see how effective the process was. Using the learning goals set as a benchmark, the learner can ascertain how effective their method /the process was and can improve on that subsequently. |
| Strategic Planning - In order to build upon existing knowledge and ideas, the learner has to determine appropriate resources for learning. Questions such as: will I need to access stored information? Will I need a teacher/facilitator/coach to explain some things to me? among others will come up.  | Focusing¬† | Reflection |
| Diagnosing Learning needs - It all starts with questions like: what do I not know? What do I need to learn and why do I want to learn this? In the example above with the new device, the owner wants to be able to use their new device (perhaps a phone in this case) effectively | Self-Instruction¬† | Adaptability |
| Determining a learning strategy - Will I learn by reading, watching, or listening to content? Will I learn by engaging in a problem-solving activity that results in the creation of something new? Will I utilize one or a combination of several learning strategies?  | Self-Monitoring¬† |  |
|  | Help-Seeking |  |
