# Reflection: SDL in Real Life

ü™û *Think back to the last time that you bought a new gadget (e.g. mobile phone, camera, computer, games console). How did you first learn how to use it?*

**Post your answer in the padlet below.**

I will assume that you unpacked the device, read the user manual (or not ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), watched some YouTube videos about your new device, or maybe even asked people who owned this model before you about some of the steps and hacks that could help you to get the best out of your new device. Then you played around with the device, testing if you could get certain features to work, and learned from your explorations. If this describes what you did, then you demonstrated self-directed learning. One of the reasons this was effective was because you had a clear goal, you wanted to be able to get the best out of this new device.

Self-directed learning is a learning process where you take responsibility to initiate and perform your own learning around a subject matter. This has numerous benefits, including strengthening your confidence as a learner and improving engagement with, and retention of, what you are learning.

# What is Self-Directed Learning?

üìô ***Self-directed learning**
The ability to set goals, plan for achievement, independently manage time and effort, and independently assess the quality of one's learning and any resulting product.*

Here is a summary of how the two most extreme types of learners (the dependent learner and the self-directed learner) compare:
- **Dependent Learner**
    - Relies on an instructor to set learning goals, monitor learning progress, and evaluate learning outcomes.
    - Is able to complete a list of instructor-created tasks
    - Has little awareness that there is an option for them to take some control over their learning
    - This type of learner is common place in traditional primary and secondary school environments, and many university environments with the "chew & pour" mentality
 
 
- **Self-Directed Learner**
    - Is able to set their learning goals, monitor learning progress, and evaluate their learning outcomes.
    - Can identify their desires, and knows what they need to do to pursue them.
    - Sees the instructor as a learning consultant who can provide advice and feedback.
    - Can identify and source the resources needed to complete their learning.
    - This type of learner is common place in on the job learning.


Self-directed learning allows you to take responsibility for your own learning, which results in greater ownership and autonomy. In self-directed learning, the teacher acts as a guide/facilitator/consultant to support you and give you feedback during your learning journey. At Kibo, you will learn using a combination of all four levels mentioned in the video during different parts of your formal academic courses, and any additional side projects that you choose to take on.


**One of the key reasons that we are teaching you self-directed learning is because this is how the majority of your learning will be once you are in a professional setting. So, it is important for you to get comfortable with taking more ownership of your learning now.**

You will notice that a lot of the characteristics discussed in the video are similar to the executive functioning skills discussed in the earlier section. Therefore, people with strong executive functioning skills are well set up to be effective self-directed learners.

**Summmary of the characteristics mentioned in the video:**
- Disciplined, Methodical
- Logical, Analytical
- Reflective and Self-Aware
- Curious and Open
- Flexible
- Interdependently Competent
- Persistent and Responsible
- Creative
- Confident
- Self-Sufficient
- Information Seeker
- Learning Process Savvy
- Critical Evaluation Skills

## Readiness to Learn v. Willingness to Learn

<aside>

**Readiness to Learn: This means a learner has all the logical tools and circumstances for being a prepared and capable learner in place.**¬†

It can include things like basic skills (such as literacy, numeracy, and the like), research and information skills, cognitive skills, critical thinking skills, life skills, communication and collaboration skills, and more. It can also mean having an actual problem to solve or a challenge to face‚Äîin essence, a purpose for¬†the learning to happen. This is the toolbox that enables learning to take place.
    
</aside>

<aside>


**Willingness to Learn:** **This is all about the¬†desire to learn.¬†It means having a real love of discovery and development and being curious and open to learning from failure.** 
    
It‚Äôs a willingness to dig in and get messy with learning and make new realizations along the way. Here we also show an interest in the expertise and wisdom of others and see everyone and everything as a potential source of meaningful learning. These are things that make our learning appealing, relevant, useful, and rewarding.

# How can you become a more self-directed learner?

## The Self-Directed Learning Process

There are three main stages to the self-directed learning process:
1) Planning = Things you do BEFORE learning takes place.
2) Monitoring = Things you do DURING the learning activity.
3) Evaluating = Things you do AFTER the learning activity.

The table below outlines behaviors that effective self-directed learners exhibit in each of these three stages.

| Planning | Monitoring | Evaluating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diagnosing Learning Needs | Attention and Focusing | Self-Evaluation |
| Goal Setting | Self-Instruction¬†¬† | Reflection |
| Strategic Planning | Help Seeking  |  |
| Determining Learning Strategy | Testing |  |


Here is some useful expansions on some of the key terms in the table:
- **Diagnosing Learning needs:** It all starts with questions like: What do I not know? What do I need to learn? Why do I want to learn this? 
- **Goal Setting:** Taking the learning needs one step further, the learner formulates clear goals by asking questions like: What will I be able to do once I have completed my learning? 
- **Strategic Planning and Determing a Learning Strategy:** In order to build upon existing knowledge and ideas, the learner has to determine an appropriate approach to, and resources for, learning. 
- **Help Seeking:** While self-directed learning is about being in control of your own learning, it doesn't mean that you need to learn alone. An important practice to use when learning, is knowing when to ask for help, where you can find help, and who you can approach for help. 
- **Testing:** When you are learning, it is critical to have an accurate signal of the gap between your current compentency and your target competency. One way to get an accruate estimate of that gap it through frequently testing yourself.
- **Self-Evaluation:** After learning strategies are implemented, the learner then evaluates their learning to see how effective the process was. Using their learning goals as a benchmark, the learner can determine how effective their learning process was and can subsequently improve on it.

‚ö†Ô∏è **An Aside on How to Ask for Help**

When you need to ask the community or Kibo team for help, one of the worst ways to ask for help is to send a message that only says, "I need help". Unfortunately, a message like this does not provide the receiver with the vital information to help you, so you won't achieve your desired outcome, i.e. quickly getting the specific help you need. Therefore, when writing a message to ask for help, be sure to include the following information:

- Details of your goal. "*I am trying to [goal].*" 
- Details of what you have tried so far. "*I have tried [details of how you have tried to solve the problem already].*"
- Any helpful context.
- Specific ask. "*Can you help me [specific ask]*"
