### Speech-to-Text: Google Docs Voice Typing

If you usually have trouble getting started with writing, a helpful technique is to turn the thoughts in your mind into concrete words on a page by just saying them aloud using a speech-to-text tool. One of the benefits of using Google Docs is that it has a built-in speech-to-text tool. 

You can supercharge this process by creating questions that you want your writing to answer and then use the voice typing tool to interview yourself in order to capture your thoughts to these questions down in written word. This can be a excellent way to **kick-start** your writing, if you tend to suffer from writer's block. You can learn more about how to use Google Doc Voice Typing by watching the video below.

### Google Docs Grammar and Spelling Checker

It is important to use a spelling and grammar checker when writing because it can help you catch typos and grammatical errors, and will improve the overall quality of your writing. Spelling and grammar mistakes can be distracting for readers and can make your writing seem careless or unprofessional. A spelling and grammar checker can help you identify and correct these mistakes, improving the clarity and credibility of your writing. In addition, using a spelling and grammar checker can help you improve your own language skills. By highlighting errors and suggesting corrections, a spelling and grammar checker can help you learn from your mistakes so that you can become a better writer.

### AI Writing Assistants: Grammarly, Wordtune, Quilbot, etc.

There are now a number of AI-powered tools that you can use to help with rewriting your sentences for clarity and impact. These work by reading the sentences that you have written, and suggesting re-writes to improve how your message is conveyed, which you have to review and decide on whether to accept or not. These tools are a powerful **support** to improve your writing, but they can't write for you. Nor should you just accept all their suggestions, without thouroughly evaluating them. Most of these tools will only allow you to access their full features if you pay, however they all provide some sort of limited free version.

> [Wordtune](https://www.wordtune.com/)

> [Quilbot](https://quillbot.com/)

**Note:** You should only be using these tools to improve the quality of your own writing. Copying the writing of others and passing it off as your own is called plagiarism, and this is a violation of the Kibo Student Code of Conduct and will result in disciplinary action. 

All of your submissions will be checked using a plagiarism tool that will be able to compare your work to writing found online. If you want to incoporate the writing of others into your work, be sure to quote, paraphrase, and cite your sources appropriately to avoid any plagiarism issues.

### Text-to-Speech: Natural Reader 

A text-to-speech app is a useful tool when working to improve your writing. The most obvious use for this tool is to allow you to "read" a large amount of text. However, there is a secondary use for such a tool that is actually more powerful. Text-to-speech apps are useful when proofreading your writing because it is often easier to hear the mistakes in your text than to see them. Sometimes when we read, we are not actually reading, but instead remembering what we think the text says. Therefore, it can be hard to catch typos. However, when we listen to our writing, we are processing the words in a new way, and typos are far easier to identify.
