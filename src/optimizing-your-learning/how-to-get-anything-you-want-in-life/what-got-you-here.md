*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

As discussed in the previous section, self-directed learning (SDL) is a powerful method for defining and achieving success in your personal and professional live. In general the SDL process consists of planning what you want to learn, monitoring your progress while learning, and evaluating the effectiveness of your learning once you are finished. Therefore, as we are living a world with an ever evolving digital landscape, it is worth exploring how you can harness a variety of technological tools (specifically AI tools) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this SDL journey. 

During the planning phase, AI tools can assist you in setting achievable goals, identifying suitable resources, and creating personalized learning pathways. By analyzing your current skill level, preferences, and interests, these tools can generate tailored recommendations, suggesting specific topics that align with your individual needs. Furthermore, they can help you create realistic schedules and prioritize tasks, ensuring that you have a well-structured plan to guide your learning process.

### AI Writing Assistants

There are now a number of AI-powered tools that you can use to help with rewriting your sentences for clarity and impact. These work by reading the sentences that you have written, and suggesting re-writes to improve how your message is conveyed, which you have to review and decide on whether to accept or not. These tools are a powerful **support** to improve your writing, but they can't write for you. Nor should you just accept all their suggestions, without thouroughly evaluating them. Most of these tools will only allow you to access their full features if you pay, however they all provide some sort of limited free version.

**Note:** You should only be using these tools to improve the quality of your own writing. Copying the writing of others and passing it off as your own is called plagiarism, and this is a violation of the Kibo Student Code of Conduct and will result in disciplinary action.

### Text-to-Speech: Natural Reader 

A text-to-speech app is a useful tool when working to improve your writing. The most obvious use for this tool is to allow you to "read" a large amount of text. However, there is a secondary use for such a tool that is actually more powerful. Text-to-speech apps are useful when proofreading your writing because it is often easier to hear the mistakes in your text than to see them. Sometimes when we read, we are not actually reading, but instead remembering what we think the text says. Therefore, it can be hard to catch typos. However, when we listen to our writing, we are processing the words in a new way, and typos are far easier to identify.
