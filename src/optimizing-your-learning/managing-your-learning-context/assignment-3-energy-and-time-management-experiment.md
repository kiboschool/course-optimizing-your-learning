## Brief

This week's assignment will require you to select one of the learning context topics listed below (all are from this week’s lesson), test it out for 3 days, and submit a reflection on your experience.

## Guidance

- After completing the 3 days, write a reflection on what went well, what didn’t go well, what you learned, and whether you will incorporate this thing into your life in the future (and if so, how you will incorporate it).
- You will need to submit both the daily documentation of your experience and the reflection. Each of these can be in any of the following formats:
    - Written
    - Video
