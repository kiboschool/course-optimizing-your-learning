# Final Presentation Milestone 2

---

Use the learning plan that you created for Milestone 1 to carry out your learning and monitor your progress.

### Some things to remember

- You should allocate 1 - 2 weeks to focus on learning your topic.
- Every group member should have some responsibility in the learning, so think about how you want to distribute the work evenly.
- After you have completed your learning, you will need to create a video lesson that teaches the lesson content to your classmates. (This will be the next milestone that you should work on during week 4 of the course).

You donâ€™t need to submit this milestone now, you will submit it in week 5 when you finish the project and submit the rest of the milestones.
