**Meet Kwaku**
  
Due to the demands of his coursework and a hectic schedule, Kwaku finds himself neglecting his nutrition. He often skips meals, relying on unhealthy snacks and fast food for convenience. Additionally, Kwaku has developed a habit of drinking atleast 5 bottles of Coke each day, and never drinks water. This combination of poor nutrition and inadequate hydration is having negative effects on Kwaku's overall well-being and academic performance. His energy levels are constantly fluctuating, leading to persistent fatigue and difficulty concentrating during classes. Kwaku struggles to retain information and finds it challenging to engage actively with the coursework. Furthermore, the lack of proper hydration means that his body is deprived of essential fluids, affecting his overall alertness, cognitive abilities, and memory retention. His excessive consumption of Coke not only fails to adequately hydrate him but also contributes to additional health concerns.

The majority of the publically available information about brain-beneficial nutrition is from American or European sources. Therefore, a lot of the foods that they recommend are native to those countries and cuisines. However, it's imporant to acknowledge that there are plently of traditional African foods that are also beneficial to your brain and body. Therefore, we've tried to find some readings that discuss these as well.
