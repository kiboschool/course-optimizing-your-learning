Learning does not happen in a vacuum, nor is it a solo endeavor. In regular in-person classrooms, we are used to attending classes with fellow students. This happens to be the same in online classrooms as well. However, being in the same classroom with others does not mean one is learning effectively ‚Äòwith‚Äô others. So, how do you ensure you have the right people in your learning space and maximize the presence and contribution of colleagues to your learning journey? 

In this lesson, we will explore how you can effecively learn with other members of the Kibo community, specifially:

- Your Peers
- Your Instructors
- Your Mentors

## Peer Learning

Let us start off with an understanding of what Peer Learning is or what is sometimes called: peer-to-peer learning.

üì∫ Watch the following video on peer learning.

Peer Learning is important because among other things when you learn with your peers:

- You engage in active learning
- You reinforce your understanding of the subject matter
- The learning is more personalized, especially in one-on-one scenarios
- You are able to build skills for working with and collaborating with others
- You are better able to understand the topic as you and your colleagues can explain things in a common language

## Peer Teaching

While Peer Learning shows us learning that can happen with colleagues during exchanges in which all learners can learn from each other at any point in time, peer teaching is another strategy that should not be confused with peer learning. Peer teaching places emphasis on the teaching role. We will also explore why Peer Teaching can be so powerful to help your learning.

## Putting Peer Learning and Teaching to Work

You might be used to a teacher or instructor as the one who assigns peer work or peer groups but as self-directed learners, peer learning is a useful learning strategy that you can initiate among yourselves for your own benefit. Here are some of the scenarios in which you can implement peer teaching and learning to improve your learning experience:

- **Collaborative Projects:** With this, you and other colleagues are either assigned a project to complete by your Faculty member or you identify a project or task and work towards solving it as a group. This involves each member of the group contributing something to the overall success and progress of the task. 
    
- **Peer Feedback and Assessments:** Feedback is important for self-awareness and self-improvement, however, we cannot truly give ourselves all the feedback we need to improve. It is for that reason that receiving peer feedback helps to reveal our blind spots and allows us to pursue more holistic growth. In peer assessment specifically, this involves ‚Äògrading‚Äô each others‚Äô work. In many cases, there is a rubric to ensure that the process is objective. With peer grading, you can learn a lot from each other‚Äôs approaches to completing a task.
    
- **Study Groups:** These are intentionally created groups of learners who engage in regular collaborative learning, many times, performing learning tasks together. Learning tasks might include study, research, discussions, and more. Study groups can last as long as they are needed and are based on the ability of everyone to commit to the group and help to make the experience rewarding for others.
    
- **Proctoring Approach:** Proctoring is a peer teaching approach where one learner, who is more advanced either in understanding or in accomplishments than another becomes responsible to help the other student learn the skills that they need to learn. In this approach, you can either be the individual who is learning or the one who is responsible for teaching. Either way, you would be accelerating your learning.
    

### Reflection: Peer Teaching and Learning Experience

## Learning from Instructors

At Kibo, instructors serve as guides on your journey through the learning experiences. You can expect that your instructor will encourage you to take ownership of your learning, and challenge you to ask questions and explore new ideas. 

### **Teacher Roles in 21st Century Online Learning**

In online classrooms, your instructor takes on the following roles:

- **Designer:** In a museum, a curator locates the best artifacts to create an effective experience for those who visit. In an online learning environment, your instructors take on the role like that of a curator as they design the course. They will guide you toward readings and other learning materials that will serve your learning goals. Based on their experience in their field, they are able to help you focus your attention on learning resources that are accurate and relevant.
- **Facilitator:**¬†¬†Your instructor carefully creates opportunities for you to learn the skills you need for your future career, and designs assignments and learning activities to lead you towards intellectual, personal, and professional growth. As you review the course presentation, consider each of the learning activities and assignments. Think about the reasons why your instructor may have selected these course components to contribute to your development.
- **Director:**¬†Online instructors are available to answer questions along the way. As you learn, you will inevitably find areas that are unclear to you, either related to the course content or your learning process. By communicating with your instructor effectively, you will take full advantage of their role in guiding you on your journey

In addition to the above, your Faculty and teachers are on hand to provide you with support as you navigate the world of online, self-directed learning.
