**Meet John**
  
John is a diligent and ambitious first-year computer science student. As his first term progresses, John finds himself increasingly stressed and anxious due to the demanding workload. He struggles with programming assignments, numerous writing assignments, and challenging theory concepts. Each day brings new deadlines, and he feels overwhelmed and unsure of how to manage it all. He has trouble sleeping because he worries about his grades and feels inadequate. Even during class time, his mind constantly drifts to the mounting pile of pending assignments. John feels isolated, seeing his classmates seemingly effortlessly handling the coursework, intensifying his self-doubt and anxiety. He hesitates to seek help, fearing judgment and not wanting to appear incapable. As his stress builds, his academic performance suffers, and he becomes forgetful, missing deadlines and skipping classes. John knows he needs to take action but feels lost and overwhelmed.

You can practice meditation by yourself with no tools or guidance, all you need to do is sit. However, if you want some additional guidance as you are learning to meditate there are lots of meditation videos and apps that you can use. I personally like the apps [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) and [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) for a easy introduction into mindfulness and meditation. Headspace also has a fantastic [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/headspace) with lots of different free meditations and breathing exercises. You will also notice that at the start of each of your weekly lessons, I have embedded a meditation video to help you focus before you start the lesson.
