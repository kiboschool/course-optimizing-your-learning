**Meet Aba**
  
From the moment the sun peeks over the horizon until the late hours of the night, Aba immerses herself in her studies. Her days are filled with coding assignments, algorithmic puzzles, and deep dives into complex programming languages. She spends countless hours in front of her computer screen, intently focused on mastering the intricacies of software development. However, this dedication to her academic pursuits comes at a cost. Aba's once-vibrant energy has dwindled, replaced by a persistent weariness that clings to her throughout the day. She finds herself struggling to maintain focus and productivity, her mind drifting as the hours tick by. The lack of physical activity takes its toll, leaving her feeling lethargic and drained.

Aba knows deep down that she needs to incorporate exercise into her daily routine. She understands that physical activity not only promotes a healthy body but also revitalizes the mind and enhances cognitive function. However, as Aba glances at her overflowing to-do list, guilt seeps in. The mountain of assignments, looming deadlines, and countless coding challenges keep her chained to her desk. The thought of taking time away from her academic responsibilities to exercise feels like a luxury she can't afford.

But as the weeks go by, Aba notices the toll her sedentary lifestyle is taking on her overall well-being. She struggles to maintain a healthy sleep schedule, often finding herself tossing and turning, her mind unable to quiet down after hours of intense screen time. Her energy levels plummet, leaving her feeling drained even before the day begins.
