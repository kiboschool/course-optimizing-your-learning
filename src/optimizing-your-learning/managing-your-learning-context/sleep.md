### Sleep Hygiene Checklist

<aside>
  
Here are some good habits that you can employ to help you get better sleep.

- **Stop using electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bed:** Electronics are cognitively engaging and can unexpectedly induce emotions (e.g., stress from an email, excitement from a story), preventing you from winding down. The bright light from electronics also disrupts a normal sleep-wake schedule by conflicting with nature's daily light-dark cycle. Don‚Äôt answer emails, peruse social media, or watch TV/movies right before you want to sleep.
- **Don‚Äôt eat, work or watch TV in bed**: If you only use your bed for sleeping, your body begins to associate the bed with rest, which can lead to deeper and more continuous sleep.
- **Nap with caution:** While naps can help after sleep deprivation, regular naps may deter nighttime sleep. Sleeping continuously at night is best, so skip the nap and sleep longer that night. If you really feel the need to nap, do it before 3pm and keep it under an hour. 
- **Keep a fixed bedtime and wake-up time:** Awakening around the same time every morning promotes a regular sleep schedule. In turn, your body learns when it is time to fall asleep. Even if it means waking up earlier on weekends or getting less sleep one night, your sleep will be better in the long term. 
- **Avoid caffeine and alcohol 4-6 hours before bed:** Caffeine and other stimulants (e.g., medications, drinks) activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol requires metabolization and this physiological arousal can fragment sleep, despite seeming to induce sleepiness initially.  
- **Do relaxing activities before bed:** Relaxing activities can promote sleepiness by reducing physiological arousal and minimizing thinking. Conversely, work or planning activities at bedtime can delay sleep, so avoid them. Ideas: stretching, calm music, slow breathing, shower. 
- **Make a worry list:** Falling asleep is harder if you are worrying or thinking about emotional things. So set aside a few minutes before bed and list everything that you want to remember for tomorrow, including worries themselves ‚Äì you can worry about them tomorrow, just not right now. 
- **Do boring activities before bed:** Boring activities slow down our cognitive processes, slowing our mind and allowing for sleepiness. Ideas: listen to a radio show or podcast in a language you don‚Äôt understand, read an uninteresting document (terms and conditions, financial reports, random  textbooks).
- **Improve  your sleeping environment:** Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures have been shown to disrupt continuous sleep. Select comfortable pillows & mattresses, remove distractions, use a sound machine, get darker curtains, wear socks. 
- **Exercise at the right time:** Exercise can facilitate or inhibit sleep. Do exercise during the day. Don‚Äôt exercise too late in the day (~2 hours before bed) because it can increase physiological arousal and delay sleep. 
- **Get up and try again:** If you can‚Äôt sleep after 20+ minutes, get up and do something relaxing or boring. Actively trying to fall asleep just frustrates you, preventing sleep. Ideas: read something boring, sit and mentally list category items (e.g. dog breeds). Don‚Äôt do anything too interesting. Once you‚Äôre sleepy, go to bed and try to sleep.  
- **Learn about sleep:** Obsessing over sleep difficulties or not understanding the science of sleep can perpetuate sleep difficulties. Read scientific articles to learn more about sleep, and thus correct misconceptions or expectations that may be exacerbating sleep related frustration or anxiety. See References for exam ples. 
- **See a professional:** If you think your sleep difficulties might extend beyond habit change, consult with your doctor or a sleep specialist. The time you take for the appointment could save you invaluable time in the future.
