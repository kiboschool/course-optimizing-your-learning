In this section we will explore ways to improve your time management. 

You will first take a self-assessment to determine your current time management skills, and then we will use a lesson on how computers operate to discuss why multi-task is ineffective due to the cost of task switching. We will then dive deeply into strategies to help you improve your time management skills including time blocking, using the Eisenhower matrix for prioritization, and avoiding procrastination. Finally, we will discuss ways to plan your time at the termly, weekly, and daily levels.

ðŸ“– Read the following textbook section on how to [create a term schedule](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/studystrategizesucceed/chapter/see-your-semester-at-a-glance/).

</aside>

> **Step 1:**Â Create a table with 7 columns, one column for each day of the week, and with one rows for each week of the semester. Label the days, Monday, Tuesday, and all the way along, across the top of the table. Then label the weeks, across the side of the table. At this point you can also add specific dates for each week of the semester.Â You can download a ready-made semester schedule by clicking in the description of this video.

**Step 2:**Â Next, gather up all of your course presentations for the semester. You should have one for each course you are taking, which includes details about the weekly schedule and readings, assignment due dates, and exams. If you have a part time job, and know your schedule, and if you have family commitments which have a regular schedule, gather up these schedules as well.

**Step 3:**Â Now, go through the course presentation looking for important details and commitments that will take place in Week 1 of the semester.Â  This could include required course readings, homework and assignments. On your semester schedule table, find the day of the week these commitments need to be completed by and write them down. Make sure to include the course name, the details of the commitment, and what it is worth if it is a graded assignment. Now keep working through your course presentation, through each week of the semester.Â  Keep following these same steps for each of your courses, until you have completed your schedule.

Now, add important life events to your semester schedule â€“ this might include work events, family events, trips and special occasions.

ðŸ“– Read the following textbook section on how to [create a weekly schedule](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/studystrategizesucceed/chapter/create-a-weekly-schedule-that-works/).

> The following principles will guide you as you create your weekly schedule:
> 
> 1. **Record your regular weekly commitments on the schedule template**. This includes any face to face or blended class times.
> 2. **Designate regular study blocks for each of your classes**. Remember that university courses typically require at least 9-12 hours of weekly study. Remember that it is more effective to study for multiple, shorter blocks of time during the week than to plan for one extended study block. Shorter study periods will allow for greater focus. Regular review will help you retain information well.
> 3. **Record meal times, family times, laundry times, etc.**
> 4. **Record all regularly scheduled personal activities**Â such as meetings, employment and athletics.
> 5. **Record any special activities**Â you need to do or want to do on a regular basis.
> 6. **Schedule to start your study period with the courses you like least or that youâ€™re not doing well in**. Try to study the same subjects at the same time each study day. Although this seems to be a mechanical way of scheduling, you will find that such a routine can help you develop a pattern for efficient and effective learning.
> 7. **Schedule a weekly review (WR) for each course**. Do it at the end of the week if possible. This weekly review gives you an opportunity to go over the past weekâ€™s notes along with the reading assignments to see what you have been learning in the past week during class and study time for each course. You can also look ahead to plan the next week and determine how much reading you need to do, what projects are due, and if any tests are scheduled.
> 8. **Keep open some time for daily physical activity**. Remember, research indicates that regular exercise will not only give you a general sense of well-being, but can reduce tension and help you accomplish a tough class, study, and work schedule.
> 9. **Label some empty blocks of time as OPEN**Â for academic or personal needs.
> 10. **Schedule some time during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**Â for you to play, relax, or do whatever you want to do. This is your reward for sticking to your schedule. In addition, youâ€™ll enjoy your free time more. Because it is scheduled you do not need to feel guilty.
