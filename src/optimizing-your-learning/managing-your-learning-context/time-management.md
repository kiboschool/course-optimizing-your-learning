**Meet Ada**
  
Ada, a first year student as Kibo, possesses immense potential, but she struggles with poor time management skills. Ada's days often lack structure and organization. She frequently finds herself procrastinating, leaving tasks until the last minute, and struggling to meet deadlines. The lack of a clear plan or routine contributes to a constant feeling of overwhelm, as she tries to juggle coursework, coding assignments, and other responsibilities.Due to her poor time management, Ada often finds herself spending excessive hours on non-productive activities such as scrolling through social media, watching videos, or getting lost in unrelated interests. This leads to a vicious cycle of falling behind on important tasks, causing stress and anxiety. Ada's disorganized approach also affects her ability to prioritize effectively. She often tackles tasks based on urgency rather than importance, which leads to neglecting critical assignments and sacrificing quality in her work. Additionally, Ada struggles to estimate the time required for each task, resulting in frequent underestimation or overestimation. This leads to time pressure, rushed work, and compromised learning opportunities. The consequences of Ada's poor time management skills begin to manifest in her academic performance. She receives lower grades than she is capable of, as she struggles to dedicate sufficient time to studying and fully grasping complex concepts. Ada's lack of structure also hampers her ability to collaborate effectively with classmates and take advantage of valuable learning opportunities.
