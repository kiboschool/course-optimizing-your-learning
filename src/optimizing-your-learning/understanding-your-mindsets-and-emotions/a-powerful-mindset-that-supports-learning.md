When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world—the world of fixed traits—success is about proving you’re smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other—the world of changing qualities—it’s about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself. In one world, failure is about having a setback. Getting a bad grade. Losing a tournament. Getting fired. Getting rejected. It means you’re not smart or talented. In the other world, failure is about not growing. Not reaching for the things you value. It means you’re not fulfilling your potential. In one world, effort is a bad thing. It, like failure, means you’re not smart or talented. If you were, you wouldn’t need effort. In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented. You have a choice. Mindsets are just beliefs. They’re powerful beliefs, but they’re just something in your mind, and you can change your mind.

A growth mindset is about believing in your ability to grow and improve.  It is a belief that intelligence can be developed through effort. It goes on to say that through “effort, persistence, and practice”, you can develop your skills and talents. This aligns pretty well with what learned in [**Week 1**](/optimizing-your-learning/how-to-get-anything-you-want-in-life/how-learning-happens.md) about the neuroplasticity of the brain.
