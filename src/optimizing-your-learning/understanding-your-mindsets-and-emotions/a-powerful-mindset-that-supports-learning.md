When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world. In one world‚Äîthe world of fixed traits‚Äîsuccess is about proving you‚Äôre smart or talented. Validating yourself. In the other‚Äîthe world of changing qualities‚Äîit‚Äôs about stretching yourself to learn something new. Developing yourself. In one world, failure is about having a setback. Getting a bad grade. Losing a tournament. Getting fired. Getting rejected. It means you‚Äôre not smart or talented. In the other world, failure is about not growing. Not reaching for the things you value. It means you‚Äôre not fulfilling your potential. In one world, effort is a bad thing. It, like failure, means you‚Äôre not smart or talented. If you were, you wouldn‚Äôt need effort. In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented. You have a choice. Mindsets are just beliefs. They‚Äôre powerful beliefs, but they‚Äôre just something in your mind, and you can change your mind.

## Reflection: Experience with Fixed and Growth Mindsets

<aside>

ü™û **Answer one of the pairs of questions in the padlet below.**

- Pair 1:
    - In what situations have you displayed a growth mindset?
    - How could this help your learning in the future?
- Pair 2:
    - In what situations have you displayed a fixed mindset?
    - How could you act differently in the future?
</aside>


<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/nw076pkpj5oma0i9" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

A growth mindset is about believing in your ability to grow and improve.  It is a belief that intelligence can be developed through effort, and that through ‚Äúeffort, persistence, and practice‚Äù, you can develop your skills and talents. This aligns well with what we learned in [**Week 1**](/optimizing-your-learning/how-to-get-anything-you-want-in-life/how-learning-happens.md) about the neuroplasticity of the brain.

Additionally, as discussed in the video, another connection between growth mindset and the lessons from week 1 is the emphasis on process over outcome. In **[Section 1.4 Direct Your Learning](optimizing-your-learning/how-to-get-anything-you-want-in-life/self-directed-learning-sdl.md)**, we talked about the importance of planning in the service of becoming more self-directed. Going through the planning steps means that when you are then monitoring or evaluating your performance against your goal, you have a clearly defined process that you can tweak to further improve your performance. 

If we think about the learnings from the previous section on Learned Helplessness, this means that planning, evaluating, and monitoring (i.e. self-directed learning) gives you the power to control your learning in times when you are successful, as well as times when you are not **yet** successful. This is extremely valuable for avoiding falling in to the trap of learned helplessness. 

When studying challenging technical subjects  the intentional planning and implementation of a learning process, allows you to focus on process and incremental improvements, and helps you avoid giving up too early while you are developing neccessary neural pathways. In times when you may not see success at first, having a learning proccess or plan to tweak means that you shouldn't feel helpless or have limiting beliefs about your ability to succeed. Instead, you can focus on trying to figure out what you need to do, how you need to learn, who you need to get help from, in order to achieve your goals.
