## Brief

This week's assignment will require you to create a Google Slides presentation about your limiting beliefs.

### Task 1 - Identify Your Limiting Beliefs

What limiting beliefs do you want to work on? Choose a problem, or an area of your life where you feel stuck or want to change. You can identify your limiting beliefs in a number of ways:

**Approach 1:** Listen for when you are feeling frustrated or disappointed, or you keep making the same mistake over and over, or you keep avoiding a task,, or you can‚Äôt overcome a challenge. Pause and think about what underlying belief could be causing this situation.


**Approach 2:** Listen out for when you say phrases that start with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äù, ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù. These are potential limiting beliefs.


**Approach 3:** Notice  times when you talk yourself out of actions that would lead you towards your long term goals. What do you tell yourself in these situations?


**Here are some examples of limiting beliefs:**
- I‚Äôll never be successful because I come from a poor background.
- It‚Äôs too late for me to become better at managing my time.
- I‚Äôm too young to create real change in the world.
- I don‚Äôt have enough money to be in control of my life.
- They will reject me because I‚Äôm not talented enough.
- I don‚Äôt have time to pursue my dreams.
- I don‚Äôt want to ask anyone for help because they will think I‚Äôm not skilled enough to succeed on my own.


### Task 2 - Limiting Belief Reflection

Pick one of the limiting beliefs that you identified in part 1 and reflect on when it was formed and how it currently impacts your life by answering the following questions:
- When do you think this belief was formed? And what was its source (e.g. family, society, a specific past experience)?
- How does holding this limiting belief currently benefit you?
- How does this limiting belief impact your actions?
- What evidence is there that makes this belief true? How might it be informed by assumptions, external expectations, or stereotypes?


### Task 3 - Changing Your Limiting Belief

Work on developing an alternate belief that reverses your initial limiting belief. First answer the following question:
- What would you predict for yourself if you no longer held this belief?

Now Reverse your belief to create an empowering belief: (e.g. I‚Äôll probably just fail at it ‚Äî> I will probably succeed.), and answer the following questions:
- How does this empowering belief make you feel?
- How true is this empowering belief? What evidence is there to support it?
- If you lived this empowering belief instead of the limiting belief, what concrete actions would you take?
- What actions could you take to help you think of your new empowering belief whenever a situation triggers the original limiting belief?


### Task 4 - Presenting Your Belief Plan

You should have now gone through a process of identifying, reflecting on, and changing your limiting belief. Your final task is to put all this into a 8-10 slide presentation. This slide presentation is what you will submit for this assignment. Your presentation should include the following information:
- 3-5 limiting beliefs that you currently hold
- Reflection on a chosen limiting belief (answer to the questions in task 2)
- Prediction of how your life would be without this limiting belief
- Your new empowering belief
- Description of how the new belief makes you feel
- Description of what your life would look like if you lived in accordance this new empowering belief
- Your action plan for reminding yourself of the empowering belief

**Make sure your slides include both text and visuals.**

## Submission

Please save your Google Slides as a pdf file and submit your assignment on Gradescope, and then upload a copy to the Woolf platform.
