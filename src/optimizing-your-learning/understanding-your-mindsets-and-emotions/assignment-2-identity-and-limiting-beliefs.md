## Brief

This week's assignment will require you to create a Google Slides presentation about your limiting beliefs.

### Task 1 - Identify Your Limiting Beliefs

What limiting beliefs do you want to work on? Choose a problem, or an area of your life where you feel stuck or want to change. You can identify your limiting beliefs in a number of ways:

**Approach 1:** Listen for when you are feeling frustrated or disappointed, or you keep making the same mistake over and over, or you keep avoiding a task,, or you can’t overcome a challenge. Pause and think about what underlying belief could be causing this situation.


**Approach 2:** Listen out for when you say phrases that start with “I can’t”, “I’m not”, “I wish”, “I shouldn’t”. These are potential limiting beliefs.


**Approach 3:** Notice  times when you talk yourself out of actions that would lead you towards your long term goals that are meaningful to you. What do you tell yourself in these situations?


*Here are some examples of limiting beliefs:
- I shouldn't speak up in class because I probably don’t have the correct answer..
- I’ll never be successful because I come from a poor background.
- It’s too late for me to change my time management skills.
- I’m too young to drive real change in the world.
- I don’t have enough money to be in control of my life.
- They will reject me because I’m not as talented as them.
- I don’t have time to pursue my dreams.
- I don’t need help from anyone because I don’t want them to think I’m not skilled nough to succeed on my own.*


### Task 2 - Limiting Belief Reflection

Pick one of the limiting beliefs that you identified in part 1 and reflect on when it was formed and how it currently impacts your life by answering the following questions:
- When do you think this belief was formed? And what was its source (e.g. family, society, a specific past experience)?
- How does holding this limiting belief currently benefit you?
- How does this limiting belief impact your actions?
- What evidence is there that makes this belief true? How might it be informed by assumptions, external expectations, or stereotypes?


### Task 3 - Changing Your Limiting Belief

Work on developing an alternate belief that reverses your initial limiting belief. First answer the following question:
- What would you predict for yourself if you no longer held this belief?

Now Reverse your belief: (e.g. I’ll probably just fail at it —> I will probably succeed.), and answer the following questions:
- How does this new belief make you feel?
- How true is this new belief? What evidence is there?
- If you lived this empowering belief instead, what concrete actions would you take?
- What actions could you take to help you think of your new belief whenever a situation triggers the original limiting belief?


### Task 4 - Presenting Your Belief Plan

You should have now gone through a process of identifying, reflecting on, and changing your limiting belief. Your final task is to put all this into a 8-10 slide presentation. This slide presentation is what you will submit for this assignment. Your presentation should include the following information:
- 3-5 limiting beliefs that you currently hold
- Reflection on a chosen limiting belief
- Prediction of how your life would be without this limiting belief
- Your new, alternate belief
- How the new belief makes you feel
- What it would look like to live this new empowering belief
- Your action plan for reminding yourself of the new belief

Make sure your slides include both text and visuals.

## Submission

Please save your Google Slides as a pdf and submit it on Gradescope, and then upload a copy to the Woolf platform.
