## Limiting Beliefs

<aside>

üó£ ‚ÄúThe only thing that‚Äôs keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself.‚Äù
‚ÄîTony Robbins

</aside>

In the previous section of this week‚Äôs lesson, you reflected on your different identities. While it is great to have a strong set of identities, as you saw in the final reflection, your identities can shape your beliefs about yourself. And as a consequence, they can shape what you believe you are capable, or deserving, of, leading to something called **limiting beliefs**.

Beliefs describe what we think we can and cannot do in life, what we think we deserve and don‚Äôt deserve in life, and what we believe to be true about the world and others. When beliefs restrict us in some way (e.g. stopping us from reaching our goals or pursuing things that would make us happy), they can be described as limiting beliefs.

Here are some examples of limiting beliefs:

- I am not talented enough to ...
- I don‚Äôt have enough experience to ...
- I can‚Äôt do this because I will fail.
- I shouldn't speak up because ...
- I‚Äôm not a leader.
- I‚Äôll never be successful.
- It‚Äôs too late for me to ...
- I‚Äôm too young to ...
- I'm too old to ...
- I don‚Äôt have enough money to ...
- They will reject me because ...
- I don‚Äôt have time to ...
- I need ... before I can ...
- I don‚Äôt need help from anyone to ...

**Limiting beliefs are usually not grounded in facts or evidence, and are often just stories that we tell ourselves based on our past negative experiences (negative emotional memories) or strongly held identities.**

### How to overcome limiting beliefs

- **Step 1 (Awareness): Recognize that you have a belief and that it is limiting**
    - Identify your limiting beliefs by:
        - Listening for when you are feeling frustrated or disappointed, or you keep making the same mistake over and over, or you can‚Äôt overcome a challenge, pause and think about what underlying belief could be causing this situation.
        - Another option is to listen out for when you say phrases that start with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äù, ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù (or any of the earlier examples of limiting beliefs). These are potential limiting beliefs.
         - You might also identify some by noticing times when you talk yourself out of actions that would lead you towards long term goals that are meaningful to you.

- **Step 2 (Question): Separate "the stories" from "the facts"**
    - Analyze the accuracy of the limiting belief by determining its source:
        - Is it informed by assumptions, external expectations, or stereotypes?
        - Are there any facts or evidence to support that the belief is true?
    - Question what you know about the situation until you are left with answers that are supported by concrete facts.
    - Look for evidence that proves or disproves your belief. Often, limiting beliefs lack solid evidence and are based on misconceptions or fear. 
    - Seek examples of people who have overcome similar challenges or have achieved what you desire, despite any perceived limitations.

- **Step 3 (Reframe) Develop an alternate belief**
    - One powerful way to develop an alternate belief is to reverse the "Limiting Belief" into an "Empowering Belief", and see what it feels like to live with this new reality. For example:
        - Limiting Belief: "I **shouldn't** speak up in class because my answer is probably **wrong** and people will think I am **dumb**."
        - Empowering Belief: "I **should** speak up in class because my answer is probably **correct** and people will think I am **smart**."

- **Step 4: (Take Action) Put the empowering belief into practice**
    - When a situation triggers the old limiting belief, think of the empowering belief instead, and let it guide your behavior.
    - You can also use quotes and visualisation to help you disrupt your "limiting belief" and replace it with your "empowering belief".
    - Some additional things that can help you overcome your limiting belief include:
        -  Visualizing success: Use the power of visualization to imagine yourself successfully overcoming your limiting beliefs. Picture yourself achieving your goals, breaking through barriers, and living your life without those self-imposed limitations. This visualization can help reinforce your new empowering beliefs.
        -  Taking small steps: Break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps. By taking action towards your goals, you'll build evidence that disproves your limiting beliefs. Celebrate each small victory along the way, as it will further strengthen your belief in your abilities.
        -  Surrounding yourself with support: Seek out positive and supportive individuals who can help you challenge your limiting beliefs. Surrounding yourself with people who believe in you and your potential can be immensely helpful in overcoming self-doubt and building confidence.
        -  Practicing self-compassion: Be kind to yourself throughout this process. Recognize that challenging and changing deep-seated beliefs takes time and effort. Treat yourself with compassion and understanding if you face setbacks or encounter resistance along the way.
        -  Repeating the process: Overcoming limiting beliefs is an ongoing process. As you grow and face new challenges, new beliefs may arise. Continually practice self-awareness and question any beliefs that hold you back, applying the steps outlined above to overcome them.



## Reflection: Limiting Beliefs

<aside> 
    
**Reminder: How to Identify Your Limiting Beliefs** üîé 

Identifying a limiting belief can sometimes be challenging, as they can be deeply ingrained and automatic. However, here are some signs that can help you recognize when something may be a limiting belief:

**Negative self-talk** 
    
If you frequently catch yourself using negative language or self-critical statements, such as "I'm not good enough" or "I always fail," it's likely a sign of a limiting belief.
    
*Example:* Chioma receives a lower grade than she expected on her first exam. She immediately starts berating herself, saying, "I'm so stupid. I'll never be able to succeed in this program. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this."

**Feelings of fear or self-doubt** 
    
Limiting beliefs often generate feelings of fear, self-doubt, or anxiety. If a particular belief or thought consistently holds you back or makes you feel inadequate, it may be a limiting belief.
    
*Example:* Kwame is assigned a group project where he has to give a presentation. He feels a surge of fear and self-doubt, thinking, "I'm not good at public speaking. I'll embarrass myself in front of the class. Maybe I should avoid taking any leadership roles."
    
**Self-imposed limitations** 

Notice if you set arbitrary limits on yourself, believing that you cannot achieve something without valid reasons. These self-imposed limitations can stem from limiting beliefs.
    
*Example:* Amina dreams of studying abroad for a semester. However, she convinces herself that it's not possible because she believes, "I don't have enough money or academic skills to study abroad. It's better not to even try."

**Repeating patterns** 
    
If you find yourself repeatedly facing similar challenges or obstacles in various areas of your life, it could indicate a common underlying limiting belief that needs to be addressed.
    
*Example:* Chukwuemeka finds himself struggling to make friends in his new environment. He recalls similar experiences from high school and concludes, "I'm just not good at making friends. It seems like everyone else effortlessly connects with others, but I'm always left out."

**Comparison and jealousy** 
    
If you frequently compare yourself to others and feel jealous or envious of their accomplishments, it may be a sign of a limiting belief about your own abilities or worth.
    
*Example:* Abena constantly compares herself to her classmates who seem to excel academically. She becomes jealous, thinking, "Everyone else is so much smarter than me. I'm just not as intelligent or capable as them. I'll never be able to keep up."

**Avoidance or procrastination** 

Limiting beliefs can often lead to avoidance or procrastination, as you may believe that you're incapable of succeeding or fear failure. Notice if you frequently find yourself avoiding challenges or putting off important tasks.
    
*Example:* Wanjiku is passionate about writing and wants to join the college newspaper. However, she constantly puts off submitting her application, believing, "I'm not a good enough writer. They won't accept me, so there's no point in trying."

**Lack of progress or growth** 
    
If you feel stuck or stagnant in certain areas of your life, it may be a result of limiting beliefs that prevent you from taking necessary steps towards growth and development.
    
*Example:* Ade has set a goal to improve his time management skills. However, he consistently falls into the habit of procrastination and fails to make progress. He thinks, "I'll never be able to manage my time effectively. It's just not something I'm capable of."

What are some limiting beliefs that you've found yourself falling prey to over the last 12 months?

</aside>

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/curriculumpad/q0h3sjpc77takwou" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

Becoming aware of your limiting beliefs requires introspection and self-reflection. Here are some techniques that you can integrate into your life to become more aware of when they might be guiding your behavior:

1. **Mindfulness:** Practice mindfulness to observe your thoughts and emotions without judgment. Pay attention to recurring patterns or negative self-talk that may indicate underlying limiting beliefs.

2. **Journaling:** Keep a journal and write down your thoughts, beliefs, and any self-limiting statements that come to mind. Regularly review your journal entries to identify common themes and beliefs that may be holding you back.

3. **Self-inquiry:** Ask yourself probing questions to explore your beliefs and thought patterns. For example, ask yourself, "What do I believe about my abilities in this area?" or "What fears or doubts come up when I think about pursuing my goals?"

4.  **Triggers and reactions:** Pay attention to situations or circumstances that trigger strong emotional reactions in you. These emotional responses can often uncover underlying beliefs or insecurities that you may not be consciously aware of.

5.  **Feedback from others:** Seek feedback from trusted friends, family, or mentors who can provide an outside perspective. Sometimes, others can spot limiting beliefs that you may not see in yourself.

6.  **Reflection:** Reflect on past experiences where you may have felt stuck or held back. Consider the beliefs that were present during those times and how they may have influenced your actions or decisions.

7.  **Comparison trap:** Be mindful of comparing yourself to others and the beliefs that arise from such comparisons. Notice if you have thoughts like "I'll never be as successful as them" or "I'm not good enough compared to them," as these can indicate limiting beliefs.

8.  **Pay attention to self-talk:** Observe the language and tone of your inner dialogue. Notice if you frequently use negative or self-critical language, as this can provide clues about your limiting beliefs.

## Learned Helplessness

The concept of learned helplessness is very similar to limiting beliefs. It is based on the idea that previous experiences can limit what you think you are capable of, even when those limitations are removed.

<aside>
  
**Meet Chinedu**

Chinedu had a passion for computers since he was young. His family encouraged his interest in technology, and he excelled in computer-related subjects in secondary school. With high hopes, he entered college to pursue a degree in Computer Science.

Initially, Chinedu found the coursework challenging but manageable. However, as he progressed through his program, he encountered more complex programming concepts and advanced algorithms that proved difficult to grasp. He started struggling to keep up with the pace of the classes and felt overwhelmed by the increasing workload.

With each setback, Chinedu's self-confidence waned, and he began doubting his abilities. Negative thoughts filled his mind, telling him, "I'm not smart enough for this," or "Everyone else seems to understand this except me." The more he believed these thoughts, the more they reinforced his sense of helplessness.

As a result, Chinedu began avoiding challenging assignments and procrastinating on projects. He convinced himself that no matter how much effort he put in, he would never reach the level of his peers. He stopped seeking help from professors or classmates, convinced that their assistance wouldn't make a difference.

With each disappointing grade, Chinedu internalized it as proof of his incompetence. He saw his failures as fixed characteristics rather than opportunities for growth. Over time, his motivation dwindled, and he found it harder to find joy in the subject he once loved.

Chinedu became passive in class discussions and group projects, believing his contributions held no value. He stopped taking risks and exploring new programming languages or techniques, fearing that he would only encounter more failure. His confidence plummeted, and he felt stuck in a cycle of self-doubt.

## Automatic Negative Thoughts (ANTS)

To close out this section, we are going to explore the driver that creates the thoughts that prop up our limiting beliefs and feelings of helplessness. These negative thoughts are often so automatic that we don't realize how much they shape how we view or interact with the world around us.

<aside>

üì∫  Watch the following video to learn about automatic negative thoughts (called thinking traps in this video).

</aside>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pwe-SyJkhCo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

**Here are some of the most common ANTs (these were all mentioned in the video):**

- **All-or-nothing Thinking:** "You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure."
- **Overgenerlization:** "You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat."
- **Mental Filter:** "You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors the entire beaker of water."
- **Disqualifying the Positive:** "You reject positive experiences by insisting they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt count‚Äù for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences."
- **Jumping to Conclusions:** "You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion."
- **Mind Reading:** "You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don‚Äôt bother to check this out."
- **Fortune Telling:** "You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact."
- **Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization:** "You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else‚Äôs achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or other fellow‚Äôs imperfections). This is also called the ‚Äúbinocular trick.‚Äù"
- **Emotional Reasoning:** "You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: ‚ÄúI feel it, therefore it must be true.‚Äù"
- **Should Statements:** "You try to motivate yourself with should and shouldn‚Äôt, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. ‚ÄúMusts‚Äù and ‚Äúoughts‚Äù are also offenders. The emotional consequences are guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment."
- **Labeling and Mislabeling:** "This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù When someone else‚Äôs behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a louse.‚Äù Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded."
- **Personalization:** "You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event, which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.‚Äù
