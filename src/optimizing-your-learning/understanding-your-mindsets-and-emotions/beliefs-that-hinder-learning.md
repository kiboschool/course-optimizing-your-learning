## Limiting Beliefs

<aside>

🗣 “The only thing that’s keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself.”
—Tony Robbins

</aside>

In the previous section of this week’s lesson, you reflected on your different identities. While it is great to have a strong set of identities, as you saw in the final reflection, your identities can shape your beliefs about yourself. And as a consequence, they can shape what you believe you are capable, or deserving, of, leading to something called **limiting beliefs**.

📺 Watch the following video for an introduction to limiting beliefs.

Beliefs describe what we think we can and cannot do in life, what we think we deserve and don’t deserve in life, and what we believe to be true about the world and others. When beliefs restrict us in some way (e.g. stopping us from reaching our goals or pursuing things that would make us happy), they can be described as limiting beliefs.

Here are some examples of limiting beliefs:

- I am not talented enough to ...
- I don’t have enough experience to ...
- I can’t do this because I will fail.
- I shouldn't speak up because ...
- I’m not a leader.
- I’ll never be successful.
- It’s too late for me to ...
- I’m too young to ...
- I don’t have enough money to ...
- They will reject me because ...
- I don’t have time to ...
- I need ... before I can ...
- I don’t need help from anyone to ...

**Limiting beliefs are usually not grounded in facts or evidence, and are often just stories that we tell ourselves based on our past negative experiences, negative emotional memories, or strongly held identities.**

## Overcoming Limiting Beliefs

- **Step 1: Recognize and Acknowledge**
    - Identify the Limiting Beliefs
    - When you are feeling frustrated or disappointed, you keep making the same mistake over and over, you can’t overcome a challenge, or you say phrases that start with “I can’t”, “I’m not”, “I wish” pause and think about what underlying belief could be causing this situation.
- **Step 2: Identify the facts**
    - Analyze the accuracy of the liming belief by identifying the facts.
    - Question what you know about the situation until you are left with answers that are supported by concrete evidence.
- **Step 3: Develop an Alternate Belief**

## Learned Helplessness

The concept of learned helplessness is very similar to limiting beliefs. It is based on the idea that previous experiences can limit what you think you are capable of, even when those limitaions are removed.
