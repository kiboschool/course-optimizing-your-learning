## Limiting Beliefs

<aside>

🗣 “The only thing that’s keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself.”
—Tony Robbins

</aside>

In the previous section of this week’s lesson, you reflected on your different identities. While it is great to have a strong set of identities, as you saw in the final reflection, your identities can shape your beliefs about yourself. And as a consequence, they can shape what you believe you are capable, or deserving, of, leading to something called **limiting beliefs**.

📺 Watch the following video for an introduction to limiting beliefs.

Beliefs describe what we think we can and cannot do in life, what we think we deserve and don’t deserve in life, and what we believe to be true about the world and others. When beliefs restrict us in some way (e.g. stopping us from reaching our goals or pursuing things that would make us happy), they can be described as limiting beliefs.

Here are some examples of limiting beliefs:

- I am not talented enough to ...
- I don’t have enough experience to ...
- I can’t do this because I will fail.
- I shouldn't speak up because ...
- I’m not a leader.
- I’ll never be successful.
- It’s too late for me to ...
- I’m too young to ...
- I'm too old to ...
- I don’t have enough money to ...
- They will reject me because ...
- I don’t have time to ...
- I need ... before I can ...
- I don’t need help from anyone to ...

**Limiting beliefs are usually not grounded in facts or evidence, and are often just stories that we tell ourselves based on our past negative experiences (negative emotional memories) or strongly held identities.**

### How to overcome limiting beliefs

- **Step 1: Recognize that you have a belief and that it is limiting**
    - Identify your limiting beliefs by:
        - Listening for when you are feeling frustrated or disappointed, or you keep making the same mistake over and over, or you can’t overcome a challenge, pause and think about what underlying belief could be causing this situation.
        - Another option is to listen out for when you say phrases that start with “I can’t”, “I’m not”, “I wish” (or any of the earlier examples of limiting beliefs. These are potential limiting beliefs.
         - You might also identify some by noticing times when you talk yourself out of actions that would lead you towards long term goals that are meaningful to you.

- **Step 2: Seperate "the stories" from "the facts"**
    - Analyze the accuracy of the liming belief by determing source of the limiting belief:
        - Is it informed by assumptions, external expectations, or stereotypes?
        - Are there any facts or evidence to support that the belief is true?
    - Question what you know about the situation until you are left with answers that are supported by concrete facts.

- **Step 3: Develop an Alternate Belief**
    - One powerful way to develop an alternate belief is to reverse the "Limiting Belief" into an "Empowering Belief", as see what it feels like to live with this new reality. For example:
        - Limiting Belief: "I **shouldn't** speak up in class because my answer is probably **wrong** and people will think I am **dumb**."
        - Empowering Belief: "I **should$$ speak up in class because my answer is probably *correct** and people will think I am **smart**."

- **Step 4: Put the Empowering Belief into Practice**
    - When a situation triggers the old limiting belief, think of the empowering belief instead, and let it guide your behavior.
    - You can also use of quotes and visualisation to help you disrupt your "limiting belief" and utilise your "empowering belief".

If creating an empowering belief seems too challenging, you can work on just questioning your limiting beliefs and trying to push through tem using the following techniques suggested by [the Open Universy](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/health-sports-psychology/psychology/reframing-self-limiting-beliefs):

<aside>
    
**Reality testing:** Ask yourself the following questions to determine how accurate your limiting belief it.
- What is my evidence for and against my thinking?
- Are my thoughts factual, or just my interpretation?
- Am I jumping to negative conclusions?
- How can I find out if these thoughts are true?

</aside>
    
<aside>
    
**Putting it in perspective:** Ask yourself the following questions to put your limiting belief into perspective.
- Is this as bad as I am making it out to be?
- What is the worst thing that could happen? How likely is it?
- What is the best thing that could happen?
- What is most likely to happen?
    
</aside>

<aside>
    
**Using goal-directed thinking:** Ask yourself the following questions to help push through your limiting belief.
- Does thinking like this help me to feel good or to achieve my goals?
- What can I do that would help solve the problem?
- What could I instead learn from this, to help me do things/feel better next time?

## Learned Helplessness

The concept of learned helplessness is very similar to limiting beliefs. It is based on the idea that previous experiences can limit what you think you are capable of, even when those limitaions are removed.
