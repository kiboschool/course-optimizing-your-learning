# Final Presentation Milestone 1

---

## Milestone 1 (Planning)

For one of your final assessments in this course, you will work in groups of 4-5 students to carry out a self-directed learning project. Your goal is to select a topic that you will learn about, create a learning plan for your group, implement the learning plan, and then submit a video lesson teaching the topic to the rest of your classmates.

For the first milestone of this project, you should complete the following activities by the end of week 2 of the course:
- Determine your group members. Your group should be 4-5 student in total, and can include students from any squad. 
- Pick your learning topic and set your specific learning goals. You can pick any topic that interests you, but note that you will only have 1-2 weeks to learn the topic well enough to be able to create your lesson video, so pick a topic and learning goals that are feasible in that timeframe.
- Answer the SDL Planning questions listed below.
- Create a group learning plan that distributes responsibilities to different group members.

### SDL Planning Questions
- What do we want to learn?
- Why is this topic important to us?
- How do we intend to use this knowledge?
- What are our current capabilities and limitations in relation to learning this topic?
- What do we already know about this topic and what do we need to find out?
- Where can we find the information that we need? (e.g. resources, data sources, people)
- How will our learning take place? (Note: that you will be focused on your learning during weeks 3 and 4 of the course)
- How will we know that our learning was successful?

You donâ€™t need to submit this milestone now, you will submit it in week 5 when you finish the project and submit the rest of the milestones.
