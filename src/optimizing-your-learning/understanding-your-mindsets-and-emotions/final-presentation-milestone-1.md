# Final Presentation Milestone 1

## Milestone 1 (Planning)

For one of your final assessments in this course, you will carry out a self-directed learning project by yourself. Your goal is to select a topic to learn, create a learning plan, implement the learning plan, and then submit a video lesson teaching the topic to the rest of your classmates.

For the first milestone of this project, you should complete the following activities by the end of week 2 of the course:
- Pick your learning topic and set your specific learning goals. You can pick any topic that interests you, but note that you will only have 1-2 weeks to learn the topic well enough to be able to create your lesson video, so pick a topic and learning goals that are feasible in that timeframe.
- Answer the SDL Planning questions listed below.
- Create a learning plan for how you will achieve your learning goals.

### SDL Planning Questions
- What do I want to learn?
- Why is this topic important to me?
- How do I intend to use this knowledge?
- What are my current capabilities and limitations in relation to learning this topic?
- What do I already know about this topic and what do I need to find out?
- Where can I find the information that I need? (e.g. resources, data sources, people)
- How will my learning take place? (Note: you will be focused on your learning during weeks 3 and 4 of the course)
- How will I know that my learning was successful?

You donâ€™t need to submit this milestone now, you will submit it in week 5 when you finish the project and submit the rest of the milestones.
