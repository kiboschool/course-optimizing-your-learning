This week, we started out discussing the importance of emotions in the learning process and how emotions can improve or hinder your cognitive performance. Hopefully, you are also discovering that we can understand and manage our emotions to aid us in achieving optimum results in our learning and activities.

Letâ€™s start this section by reflecting on your experience with managing your emotions and the emotions of others, before diving into the topic of emotional intelligence in a bit more depth.

- **P** = Perceiving Emotions
    
    > the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifactsâ€”including the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.
    > 
- **U** = Using Emotions
    
    > the ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem-solving. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changingÂ moods in order to best fit the task at hand.
    > 
- **U** = Understanding Emotions
    
    > the ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions. For example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.
    > 
- **M** = Managing Emotions
    
    > the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. Therefore, the emotionally intelligent person can harness emotions, even negative ones, and manage them to achieve intended goals.

According to Daniel Goleman, who has researched and written extensively on the subject, Emotional Intelligence is made up of the following components or skills:

- **Self-Awareness**
    
    This is the ability to recognize our own emotions and state of mind and understand the impact it has on us and other people around us.  It is the ability to understand how our emotions drive our behavior and actions. More broadly, self-awareness involves knowing our identity, personality, preferences, and strengths/weaknesses among other things which are in many ways connected to how we feel and how we act. being able to know how we feel and how that drives us in the moment can help us appreciate and channel those feelings/emotions appropriately.
    
- **Self-Regulation (or Self-Management)**
    
    This is the ability to control, manage or regulate our emotions at any point in time in order to serve the purpose of the goals we have at hand. It also helps us to respond appropriately in our relationships and interactions with others. We might not be able to always trace the source of our emotions or control when and how they come but the good news is that with learning and practice, we can control how those emotions affect or drive us.
    
- **Motivation**
    
    Motivation is the quality of being driven by something whether it is internal or external. As a quality of emotional intelligence, motivation helps us sustain appropriate or preferred actions even in the face of conflicting or contrary emotions. Motivation is the drive to improve ourselves, learn, grow and achieve our goals. Motivation helps us to be resilient, persevere, and forge ahead in the face of difficulty. Learning new and difficult subjects can be daunting and many people give up midway but with a good understanding of what motivates us and knowing how to channel and sustain our motivation, we can push through to accomplish our goals. 
    
- **Social Awareness (or Empathy)**
    
    Empathy is the ability to be able to put ourselves in the shoes of others. With empathy, we can imagine what others are feeling and experiencing and we can choose to understand and react to them based on the perceived feelings of their situation. Empathy can be practiced by listening to others and observing them and the situations they are in.  
    
- **Social Skills (or Relationship Management)**
    
    Social skills help us to bring all the skills of emotional intelligence into cordial and effective relationships with other people whether at work or in life. Social skills is the ability to interact well with people and build relationships with them. Without the previous set of emotional intelligence skills, it is hard to possess/practice social skills. This means that our ability to be successful in relationships with people begins with our ability to understand ourselves, and our emotions and be successful in relating with ourselves.
