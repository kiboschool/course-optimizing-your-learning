ðŸ—£ There is no separation of mind and emotions; emotions, thinking, and learning is all linked.

In last weekâ€™s lesson, we explored the importance of self-directed learning. We emphasized the need for you to be at the center of the learning process and to be able to set learning goals, monitor learning progress, and evaluate learning outcomes. This week, we will dive into how your mind influences your ability to successfully accomplish these tasks. 

It may be obvious that thinking and logic play an important role in self-directed learning, but how about emotions? What role do they have to play in your ability to learn? How do your emotions help you get the most out of your learning or how might they hold you back? The goal of this weekâ€™s lesson is to help you find answers to these questions and many more!

## Discuss: Emotions When Learning

ðŸ’¬ Imagine you are creating a quiz game using Python, but every time you run your code you keep getting the same error message. Youâ€™ve spent 3 hours looking through every line of your code and canâ€™t understand what is causing the bug. 

**In the padlet below, post one word or phrase to describe how you would feel in that situation.**

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/2qcw87dik3cmj7zv" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

When you hit roadblocks like this (and there will be plenty of roadblocks in your learning!), you are likely to feel emotions like anger and frustration. These sorts of situations will possibly also affect your mood, your ability to concentrate, and how you interact with people around you. However, being able to understand and regulate your emotions will prevent you from wasting your time and energy and taking out your frustration in unproductive ways, and will instead help you to pause and think calmly so that you can resolve the issues with your code and achieve your ultimate goal. To help us unravel how to do this, letâ€™s start by learning what emotions are, and how they influence our brains.

But how do emotions influence learning?

From this video, we learned that the quality of our learning is dependent on both our cognitive skills (how we think) and our emotional state (how we feel). In fact, our emotional state impacts our ability to leverage our cognitive abilities to achieve learning goals. For example, emotions can have a positive or negative impact on our attention, motivation, effective employment of learning strategies, and ability to self-regulate.

ðŸ“º Watch the following video on the different ways that positive and negative emotions impact learning.

From the video, we learned that negative emotions (e.g. anxiety, fear) tend to narrow our focus onto the threat. However, positive emotions (e.g. curiosity, joy, pride) broaden our thoughts and ideas, helping us to be more creative, improving our capacity to learn, and helping us bounce back from failure. Negative memories can lead to negative emotional responses like anxiety and frustration that hinder our ability to learn when we are put in situations that elicit memories of the past experiences. As such, it is important that we learn how to recognize when these emotions occur (through self-awareness), and effectively manage them (through self-regulation).  One thing to note is that sometimes negative emotions can be useful in learning, a small amount of anxiety can help us focus, which can be good for learning. However, if the anxiety is significant and frequent, it can distract us when we are trying to learn.

> We used to think that if people did well, then they feel goodâ€¦we now know that that was the wrong way around. Actually, if people feel good then that provides the fuel for them to do well.

Curiosity is regarded as a strong positive emotion that drives learning. When there is a genuine curiosity to grow, improve and discover, learning is much more fun than when learning is driven by the need to perform, pass or get good grades. Learners who possess curiosity tend to go further and to put in more effort as compared to learners who want just to put in the bare minimum.

## Discuss: Impact of Emotions When Learning

<aside>


ðŸ’¬ Have you ever experienced a negative emotion (e.g. anxiety, fear, anger) or a positive emotion (e.g. joy, curiosity, pride, enthusiasm) during a learning or assessment activity? If yes, how did it help or hinder your ability to perform during this learning or assessment? 

**Post your responses in the padlet below.**
