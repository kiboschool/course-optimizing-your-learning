## Course Introduction

Kibo‚Äôs mission is to educate collaborative innovators who use technology to solve pressing problems. 

For you to become a "collaborative innovator", you will need to be able to direct your learning, reflect critically, and course correct when needed, so that you can effectively deepen your expertise in the subject matter of focus. 

Optimizing Your Learning aims to give you the tools to do this successfully. You will learn why self-directed learning and learning how to learn can drive long-term success. You will also learn about how to understand and harness your identities, beliefs, and interests to develop learning habits grounded in ownership, motivation, and persistence. Finally, you will be introduced to a variety of learning strategies and approaches that will help shape the development of powerful and effective learning mindsets and skills. 

We hope that all these will allow you to gain a mastery of, and confidence in, your ability to achieve your goals at Kibo and beyond. As a result, we hope that you will see challenges that you encounter in a new light, as hurdles that can be overcome. While also seeing yourself in a new light, as an individual who can uncover what it takes to solve even the most complex problems. 

Over the 5 weeks of this course we will explore 4 main thematic areas:
**In week 1**, we will focus on why effective learning is important in the 21st century, and what learning actually entails. 

**In week 2**, we will start discussing how to learn effectively, by first exploring the mental and emotional factors that influence learning.

**In week 3**, we will move from mind to body, and explore the bodily factors that influence learning (e.g. stress, food, movement, sleep) and other critical external factors (e.g. physical environment, other people).

**In week 4**, we will explore a variety of tactics that you can employ to optimize your learning (e.g. forming habits, improving your focus and memory, getting into the flow state) and specific learning strategies that you can employ before, during, and after learning to make yourself a more effective and efficient learner. 

**Week 5** will be a chance for you to focus on your final project and final group presentation so that you can consolidate the knowledge, skills, and mindsets that you were introduced to during the previous 4 weeks.

Since the goal of this course is to help you improve your learning skills, there will be lots of opportunities to test out some of the techniques shared in the lessons in our weekly live classes, weekly assignments, and the practice activities and discussions that are embedded throughout the lessons.
